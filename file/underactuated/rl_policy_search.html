<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 19"><h1>Model-Free Policy Search</h1>

  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a collection of algorithms for solving the
  same optimal control problem that we've focused on through the text, but the
  real gems from the RL literature are the algorithms for (almost) <i>black-box
  optimization</i> of stochastic optimal control problems. The idea of an
  algorithm that only has a "black-box" interface to the optimization problem
  means that it can obtain (potentially noisy) samples of the optimal cost via
  trial and error, but does not have access to the underlying model, and does
  not have direct access to complete gradient information.</p>

  <p>This is a hard problem!   In general we cannot expect RL algorithms to
  optimize as quickly as more structured optimization, and we can typically only
  guarantee convergence to a local optima at best.  But the framework is
  extremely general, so it can be applied to problems that are inaccessible to
  any of the other algorithms we've examined so far.  My favorite examples for
  reinforcement learning are control in complex fluid dynamics (e.g.
  <elib>Roberts09a</elib>). These systems are often very difficult to model, or
  the model is so high-dimensional and complicated so that it's prohibitive for
  control design. In these problems, it might actually be faster to optimize via
  trial-and-error in physical experiments. </p>

  <p>In this chapter we will examine one particular style of reinforcement
  learning that attempts to find good controllers by explicitly parameterizing a
  family of policies (e.g. via a parameter vector $\alpha$), then searching
  directly for the parameters that optimize the long-term cost.  For a
  stochastic optimal control problem with our favorite additive form of the
  objective, this might look like: \begin{equation} \min_\alpha E \left[
    \sum_{n=0}^N
  \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]) \right]\end{equation} where the random variables are drawn
    from
  probability densities \begin{gather*}\bx[0] \sim p_0(\bx),\\ \bx[n] \sim
  p(\bx[n] | \bx[n-1], \bu[n-1]), \\ \bu[n] \sim p_\alpha(\bu[n] |
  \bx[n]).\end{gather*}  The last equation is a probabilistic representation of
  the control policy -- on each time-step actions $\bu$ are drawn from a
  distribution that is conditioned on the current state, $\bx$.</p>

  <p>Of course, the controls community has investigated ideas like this, too,
  for instance under the umbrellas of <i>extremum-seeking control</i> and
  <i>iterative learning control</i>.  I'll try to make connections whenever
  possible.</p>

  <section><h1>Policy Gradient Methods</h1>

    <p>One of the standard approaches to policy search in RL is to estimate the
    gradient of the expected long-term cost with respect to the policy
    parameters by evaluating some number of sample trajectories, then performing
    (stochastic) gradient descent.  Many of these so-called "policy gradient"
    algorithms leverage a derivation called the <em>likelihood ratio method</em>
    that was perhaps first described in <elib>Glynn90</elib> then popularized in
    the the REINFORCE algorithm <elib>Williams92</elib>.  It is based on what
    looks like a trick with logarithms to estimate the gradient; I feel like
    this trick is often presented with an air of mystery about it.  Let's try to
    make sure we understand it.</p>

    <subsection><h1>The Likelihood Ratio Method (aka
      REINFORCE)</h1>

      <p>Let's start with a simpler optimization over a stochastic function:
      $$\min_\alpha E\left[ \ell(\bx) \right] \text{ with } \bx \sim p_\alpha(\bx)
      $$  I hope the notation is clear?  $\bx$ is a random vector, drawn from
      the distribution $p_\alpha(\bx)$, with the subscript indicating that the
      distribution depends on the parameter vector $\alpha$.  What is the
      gradient of this function?  The REINFORCE derivation is \begin{align*}
      \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} E \left[ g(\bx) \right] =&
      \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \int d\bx ~ g(\bx) p_\alpha(\bx) \\ =&
      \int  d\bx ~ g(\bx) \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} p_\alpha(\bx)  \\ =&
      \int d\bx ~ g(\bx) p_\alpha(\bx) \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha}  \log
      p_\alpha(\bx)   \\ =& E\left[ g(\bx) \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \log
      p_\alpha(\bx) \right]. \end{align*} To achieve this, we used the
      derivative of the logarithm: \begin{gather*} y = \log u \\ \frac{\partial
      y}{\partial u} = \frac{1}{u} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \end{gather*}
      to write $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} p_\alpha(\bx) = p_\alpha(\bx)
      \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \log p_\alpha(\bx).$$ This suggests a
      simple Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the policy gradient: draw $N$
      random samples $\bx_i$ then estimate the gradient as $$
      \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} E \left[ g(\bx) \right] \approx
      \frac{1}{N} \sum_i g(\bx_i) \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \log
      p_\alpha(\bx_i).$$</p>

      <p>This trick is even more potent in the optimal control case.  For a
      finite-horizon problem we have \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial
      \alpha} E \left[ \sum_{n=0}^N \ell(\bx[n], \bu[n]) \right] =& \int
      d\bx[\cdot] d\bu[\cdot] \left[ \sum_{n=0}^N \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]) \right]
      \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} p_\alpha(\bx[\cdot], \bu[\cdot]) \\ =&
      E\left[ \left(\sum_{n=0}^N \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])\right)
      \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \log p_\alpha(\bx[\cdot],\bu[\cdot])
      \right], \end{align*} where $\bx[\cdot]$ is shorthand for the entire
      trajectory $\bx[0], ..., \bx[n]$, and $$ p_\alpha(\bx[\cdot],\bu[\cdot]) =
      p_0(\bx[0]) \left(\prod_{n=1}^N p(\bx[n] | \bx[n-1],\bu[n-1]) \right)
      \left(\prod_{n=0}^N p_\alpha(\bu[n] | \bx[n]) \right).$$ Taking the $\log$
      we have $$\log p_\alpha(\bx[\cdot],\bu[\cdot]) = \log p_0(\bx[0]) +
      \sum_{n=1}^N \log p(\bx[n] | \bx[n-1],\bu[n-1]) + \sum_{n=0}^n \log
      p_\alpha(\bu[n] | \bx[n]).$$  Only the last terms depend on $\alpha$,
      which yields \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} E \left[
      \sum_{n=0}^N \ell(\bx[n], \bu[n]) \right] &= E\left[ \left( \sum_{n=0}^N
      \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]) \right) \left(\sum_{k=0}^N \frac{\partial}{\partial
      \alpha} \log p_\alpha(\bu[k]|\bx[k]) \right) \right] \\ &= E\left[
      \sum_{n=0}^N \left( \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]) \sum_{k=0}^n
      \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \log p_\alpha(\bu[k]|\bx[k]) \right)
      \right], \end{align*} where the last step uses the fact that
      $E\left[\ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \log
      p_\alpha(\bu[k]|\bx[k]) \right] = 0$ for all $k > n$.</p>

      <p>This update should surprise you.  It says that I can find the gradient
      of the long-term cost by taking only the gradient of the policy... but not
      the gradient of the plant, nor the cost!  The intuition is that one can
      obtain the gradient by evaluating the policy along a number of (random)
      trajectory roll-outs of the closed-loop system, evaluating the cost on
      each, then increasing the probability in the policy of taking the actions
      correlated with lower long-term costs.</p>

      <p>This derivation is often presented as <b>the</b> policy gradient
      derivation.  The identity is certainly correct, but I'd prefer that you
      think of this as just one way to obtain the policy gradient. It's a
      particularly clever one in that it uses exactly the information that we
      have available in reinforcement learning -- we have access to the
      instantaneous costs, $\ell(\bx[n], \bu[n])$, and to the policy -- so are
      allowed to take gradients of the policy -- but does not require any
      understanding whatsoever of the plant model.   Although it's clever, it is
      not particularly efficient -- the Monte Carlo approximations of the
      expected value have a high variance, so many samples are required for an
      accurate estimate.  Other derivations are possible, some even simpler, and
      others that <b>do</b> make use of the plant gradients if you have access
      to them, and these will perform differently in the finite-sample
      approximations.</p>

      <p>For the remainder of this section, I'd like to dig in and try to
      understand the nature of the stochastic update a little better, to help
      you understand what I mean. </p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Sample efficiency</h1>

      <p>Let's take a step back and think more generally about how one can use
      gradient descent in black-box (unconstrained) optimization. Imagine you
      have a simple optimization problem: $$\min_\alpha g(\alpha),$$ and you can
      directly evaluate $g()$, but not $\frac{\partial g}{\partial \alpha}$.
      How can you perform gradient descent?</p>

      <p>A standard technique for estimating the gradients, in lieu of
      analytical gradient information, is the method of finite
      differences<elib>Press92</elib>. The finite differences approach to
      estimating the gradient involves making the same small perturbation,
      $\epsilon$ to the input parameters in every dimension independently, and
      using: $$\pd{g}{\alpha_i} \approx \frac{g(\balpha+{\bf \epsilon}_i) -
      g(\alpha)}{\epsilon},$$ where ${\bf \epsilon_i}$ is the column vector with
      $\epsilon$ in the $i$th row, and zeros everywhere else.  Finite difference
      methods can be computationally very expensive, requiring $n+1$ evaluations
      of the function for every gradient step, where $n$ is the length of the
      input vector.</p>

      <p>What if each function evaluation is expensive?  Perhaps it means
      picking up a physical robot and running it for 10 seconds for each
      evaluation of $g()$.  Suddenly there is a premium on trying to optimize
      the cost function with the fewest number of evaluations on $g()$.  This is
      the name of the game in reinforcement learning -- it's often called RL's
      <i>sample complexity</i>.  Can we perform gradient descent using less
      evaluations?</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Stochastic Gradient Descent</h1>

      <p>This leads us to the question of doing approximate gradient descent, or
      "stochastic" gradient descent.  Thinking of the cost landscape as a
      Lyapunov function&dagger;<sidenote>&dagger; the Lyapunov function $V
      (\alpha) = g(\alpha) - g(\alpha^*)$ is commonly used in
      convergence/stability analysis of optimization algorithms. <todo>cite e.g.
      Ben Recht?</todo></sidenote>, then any update that moves downhill on each
      step will eventually reach the optimal.  More generally, any update that
      moves downhill on average will eventually reach a minimum... and sometimes
      "stochastic" gradient descent updates that occassionally go uphill but go
      downhill on average can even have desirable properties like bouncing out
      of small local minima.  The figure below gives some graphical intuition;
      for a formal treatment of stochastic gradient methods, see e.g.
      <elib>Bertsekas99</elib>.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>The Weight Pertubation Algorithm</h1>

      <p>Instead of sampling each dimension independently, consider making a
      single small random change, $\bbeta$, to the parameter vector, $\balpha$.
      Now consider the update of the form: $$\Delta \balpha= -\eta [ g(\balpha +
      \bbeta) - g(\balpha)]\bbeta.$$  The intuition here is that if
      $g(\balpha+\bbeta) < g(\balpha)$, then $\bbeta$ was a good change and
      we'll move in the direction of $\bbeta$.  If the cost increased, then
      we'll move in the opposite direction.  Assuming the function is smooth and
      $\bbeta$ is small, then we will always move downhill on the Lyapunov
      function.</p>

      <p>Even more interesting, on average, the update is actually in the
      direction of the true gradient.  To see this, again we can assume the
      function is locally smooth and $\bbeta$ is small to write the Taylor
      expansion: $$g(\balpha + \bbeta) \approx g(\balpha) +
      \pd{g}{\balpha}\bbeta.$$  Now we have \begin{align*}\Delta \balpha
      \approx& -\eta \left[ \pd{g}{\alpha} \bbeta \right] \bbeta = -\eta \bbeta
      \bbeta^T \pd{g}{\balpha}^T \\ \avg{\Delta \balpha} \approx& -\eta
      \avg{\bbeta \bbeta^T} \pd{g}{\balpha}^T \end{align*} If we select each
      element of $\bbeta$ independently from a distribution with zero mean and
      variance $\sigma_\beta^2$, or $\avg{ \beta_i } = 0, \avg{ \beta_i \beta_j
      } = \sigma_\beta^2 \delta_{ij}$, then we have $$\avg{\Delta \balpha}
      \approx -\eta \sigma_\beta^2 \pd{g}{\balpha}^T.$$ Note that the
      distribution $p_{\alpha}(\bx)$ need not be Gaussian, but it is the
      variance of the distribution which determines the scaling on the
      gradient.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Weight Perturbation with an Estimated
      Baseline</h1>

      <p>The weight perturbation update above requires us to evaluate the
      function $g$ twice for every update of the parameters.  This is low
      compared to the method of finite differences, but let us see if we can do
      better.  What if, instead of evaluating the function twice per update
      [$g(\balpha+\bbeta)$ and $g(\balpha)$], we replace the evaluation of
      $g(\balpha)$ with an estimator, $b = \hat{g}(\balpha)$, obtained from
      previous trials?  In other words, consider an update of the form:
      \begin{equation} \Delta \balpha= - \frac{\eta}{\sigma_\beta^2}
      [ g(\balpha + \bbeta) - b]\bbeta
      \label{eq:weight_perturbation_baseline} \end{equation} The estimator can
      take any of a number of forms, but perhaps the simplest is based on the
      update (after the $n$th trial): $$b[n+1] = \gamma g[n] + (1 -
      \gamma)b[n],\quad b[0] = 0, 0\le\gamma\le1,$$ where $\gamma$ parameterizes
      the moving average.  Let's compute the expected value of the update, using
      the same Taylor expansion that we used above: \begin{align*} E[\Delta
      \balpha] =& -\frac{\eta}{\sigma_\beta^2}  \avg{ [g(\balpha) +
      \pd{g}{\balpha}\bbeta - b]\bbeta} \\ =& -\frac{\eta}{\sigma_\beta^2}
      \avg{[g(\balpha)-b]\bbeta} -\frac{\eta}{\sigma_\beta^2} \avg{\bbeta
        \bbeta^T}\pd{g}{\balpha}^T \\
      =& - \eta \pd{g}{\balpha}^T \end{align*} In other words, the baseline does
      not effect our basic result - that the expected update is in the direction
      of the gradient.  Note that this computation works for any baseline
      estimator which is uncorrelated with $\bbeta$, as it should be if the
      estimator is a function of the performance in previous trials.</p>

      <p>Although using an estimated baseline doesn't effect the average update,
      it can have a dramatic effect on the performance of the algorithm.
        As we will see in a later section, if the evaluation of $g$ is
      stochastic, then the update with a baseline estimator can actually
      outperform an update using straight function evaluations.</p>

      <todo>
  % Note: it would be very interesting to look at the performance of
  % estimated baselines vs. perfect baselines (one has higher variance,
  % but allows 2x the updates for the same number of function evaluations).
      </todo>

      <p>Let's take the extreme case of $b=0$.  This seems like a very bad
      idea... on each step we will move in the direction of every random
      perturbation, but we will move more or less in that direction based on the
      evaluated cost. In average, we will still move in the direction of the
      true gradient, but only because we will eventually move more downhill than
      we move uphill.  It feels very naive.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>REINFORCE w/ additive Gaussian noise</h1>

      <p>Now let's consider the simple form of the REINFORCE update:
      \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} E \left[ g(\bx) \right] =
      E\left[ g(\bx) \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \log p_\alpha(\bx)
      \right]. \end{align*}  It turns out that weight perturbation is a
      REINFORCE algorithm.  To see this, take $\bx = \balpha + \bbeta$, $\bbeta
      \in N(0,\sigma^2)$, to have \begin{gather*} p_{\balpha}(\bx) =
      \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^N} e^{\frac{-(\bx-\balpha)^T(\bx -
      \balpha)}{2\sigma^2}} \\ \log p_{\balpha}(\bx) =
      \frac{-(\bx-\balpha)^T(\bx - \balpha)}{2\sigma^2} + \text{terms that don't
      depend on }\balpha \\ \pd{}{\balpha} \log p_{\balpha}(\bx) =
      \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (\balpha - \bx)^T = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \bbeta^T. \\
      \end{gather*} If we use only a single trial for each Monte-Carlo
      evaluation, then the REINFORCE update is $$\Delta \balpha =
      -\frac{\eta}{\sigma^2} g(\balpha + \bbeta) \bbeta,$$ which is precisely
      the weight perturbation update (the crazy version with $b=0$ discussed
      above).  Although it will move in the direction of the gradient on
      average, it can be highly inefficient.  In practice, people use many more than one sample to estimate the poilicy gradient.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Summary</h1>

      <p>The policy gradient "trick" from REINFORCE using log probabilities
      provides one means of estimating the true policy gradient.  It is not the
      only way to obtain the policy gradient... in fact the trivial
      weight-perturbation update obtains the same gradient for the case of a
      policy with a mean linear in $\alpha$ and a fixed diagonal covariance.
      It's cleverness lies in the fact that it makes use of the information we
      do have (instantaneous cost values and the gradients of the policy), and
      that it provides an unbiased estimate of the gradient (note that taking
      the gradients of a model that is only slightly wrong might not have this
      virtue).  But its inefficiency comes from having a potentially very high
      variance. Variance reduction for policy gradient, often through baseline
      estimation, continues to be an active area of research.</p>

  <section><h1>Sample performance via the signal-to-noise
  ratio.</h1>

    <subsection><h1>Performance of Weight Perturbation</h1>

      <p>The simplicity of the REINFORCE / weight perturbation updates makes it
      tempting to apply them to problems of arbitrary complexity.  But a major
      concern for the algorithm is its performance - although we have shown that
      the update is in the direction of the true gradient <i>on average</i>, it
      may still require a prohibitive number of computations to obtain a local
      minima.</p>

      <p>In this section, we will investigate the performance of the weight
      perturbation algorithm by investigating its <i>signal-to-noise</i> ratio
      (SNR).   This idea was explored in <elib>Roberts09a</elib> -- my goal is
      just to give you a taste here. The SNR is the ratio of the power in the
      signal (here desired update in the direction of the true gradient) and the
      power in the noise (the remaining component of the update, so that
      $\Delta\balpha = -\eta\pd{g}{\balpha}^T + $
      noise)&dagger;<sidenote>&dagger; SNR could alternatively be defined as the
      ratio of the power of the component of the update in the direction of the
      signal and the component orthogonal to the signal (does not penalize the
      magnitudes of the updates): $$\frac{E[a^2]}{E\left[\left|\Delta\balpha -
      a{\bf v} \right|^2\right]},$$ where ${\bf v} =
      \frac{\pd{g}{\balpha}^T}{\left|\pd{g}{\balpha}^T\right|},$ $a = \Delta
      \balpha \cdot {\bf v}$.  This form is probably a better definition, but is
      more difficult to work with.</sidenote> $$\text{SNR} = \frac{\left|-\eta
      \pd{g}{\balpha}^T\right|^2}{\avg{\left|\Delta \balpha + \eta
      \pd{g}{\balpha}^T \right|^2}}.$$ In the special case of the unbiased
      update, the equation reduces to: $$\text{SNR} =
      \frac{\avg{\Delta\balpha}^T\avg{\Delta\balpha}}
      {\avg{(\Delta\balpha)^T(\Delta\balpha)} -
      \avg{\Delta\balpha}^T\avg{\Delta\balpha}}.$$</p>

      <p>For the weight perturbation update we have: $$\avg{\Delta
      \balpha}^T\avg{\Delta \balpha} = \eta^2 \pd{g}{\balpha} \pd{g}{\balpha}^T
      = \eta^2 \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \pd{g}{\alpha_i} \right)^2,$$
      \begin{align*} \avg{(\Delta \balpha)^T(\Delta \balpha)} =&
      \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^4} \avg{\left[g(\balpha+\bbeta) -

      the $n$th central moment of $z$: $$\mu_n(z) = \avg{(z - \avg{z})^n}.$$
      Putting it all together, we have: $$\text{SNR} = \frac{1}{N - 2 +
      \frac{\mu_4(\beta_i)}{\sigma_\beta^4}}.$$</p>

      <example><h1>Signal-to-noise ratio for additive Gaussian
        noise</h1>

        <p>For $\beta_i$ drawn from a Gaussian distribution, we have $\mu_1 = 0,
        \mu_2 = \sigma^2_\beta, \mu_3 = 0, \mu_4 = 3 \sigma^4_\beta,$
        simplifying the above expression to: $$\text{SNR} = \frac{1}{N+1}.$$</p>

      </example>

      <example><h1>Signal-to-noise ratio for additive uniform
        noise</h1>

        <p>For $\beta_i$ drawn from a uniform distribution over [-a,a], we have
        $\mu_1 = 0, \mu_2 = \frac{a^2}{3} = \sigma_\beta^2, \mu_3 = 0, \mu_4 =
        \frac{a^4}{5} = \frac{9}{5}\sigma_\beta^4,$ simplifying the above to:
        $$\text{SNR} = \frac{1}{N-\frac{1}{5}}.$$</p>

      </example>

      <p>Performance calculations using the SNR can be used to design the
      parameters of the algorithm in practice.  For example, based on these
      results it is apparent that noise added through a uniform distribution
      yields better gradient estimates than the Gaussian noise case for very
      small $N$, but that these differences are neglibile for large $N$.</p>

      <p>Similar calculations can yield insight into picking the size of the
      additive noise (scaled by $\sigma_\beta$).  The calculations in this
      section seem to imply that larger $\sigma_\beta$ can only reduce the
      variance, overcoming errors or noise in the baseline estimator,
      $\tilde{b}$; this is a short-coming of our first-order Taylor expansion.
      If the cost function is not linear in the parameters, then an examination
      of higher-order terms reveals that large $\sigma_\beta$ can increase the
      SNR.  The derivation with a second-order Taylor expansion is left for an
      exercise.</p>

  \begin{matlabex}[Weight perturbation on a quadratic cost]
  \label{ex:weight_perturbation_quadratic}
  In this problem we will optimize a cost quadratic cost function using
  weight perturbation.
  $$y(\balpha) = \frac{1}{2} \balpha^T {\bf A} \balpha\text{, with } {\bf A} = {\bf A}^T$$
  \begin{subex}
  Simulate the weight perturbation algorithm for ${\bf A} = {\bf I}_{2\times2}$.
  Plot the values of $\balpha$ at each iteration of the algorithm on top of
  the cost function, $y$.  Your results should resemble
  figure {weight_perturbation_quadratic}, which was made with
  these parameters.  Try using additive Gaussian noise, and additive
  uniform noise.  How does the performance of convergence depend on
  $\eta$? on $\sigma_\beta^2$?
  \end{subex}
  \begin{subex}[Signal-to-noise ratio]
  Estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of your weight pertubation update
  by holding $\balpha$ fixed and computing $\Delta \balpha$ for as many trials
  as are required for your SNR statistics to converge.  Using ${\bf A} =
  {\bf I}_{N \times N}$, make a plot of the SNR for Gaussian and uniform
  additive noise as a function of $N$.  Compare these plots with the
  theoretical predictions.
  \end{subex}

  \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}
  \end{matlabex}

  \begin{ex}[Weight perturbation performance with a baseline estimator]
  \label{p:snr_baseline}

  \begin{solution}
  Using $\tilde{b} = y(\balpha) - b$, we have:
  $$\avg{\Delta \balpha}^T\avg{\Delta \balpha} = \eta^2 \pd{J}{\balpha} \pd{J}{\balpha}^T = \eta^2
  \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \pd{J}{\alpha_i} \right)^2,$$
  \begin{align*}
  \avg{(\Delta \balpha)^T(\Delta \balpha)} =& \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^4}
  \avg{\left[y(\balpha+\bbeta) - y(\balpha)\right]^2 \bbeta^T\bbeta} \\
  \approx& \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^4} \avg{ \left[ \tilde{b} + \pd{J}{\balpha} \bbeta \right]^2 \bbeta^T\bbeta } \\
  =& \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^2} \avg{\tilde{b}^2} +
  2 \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^4} \avg{ \tilde{b} \left(\sum_i \pd{J}{\alpha_i}\beta_i\right)
  \left(\sum_j \beta_j^2 \right) } + \text{ previous
  terms} \\
  =& \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^2} \avg{\tilde{b}^2} +
  2 \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^4} \sum_{i,j} \pd{J}{\alpha_i} \avg{ \beta_i \beta_j^2 }
  + \text{ previous
  terms} \\
  =& \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^2}\sigma^2_{\tilde{b}} +
  2 \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma^4} \sum_i \pd{J}{\alpha_i} \mu_3(\beta_i) + \eta^2 (N-1)
  \sum_i \left( \pd{J}{\alpha_i} \right)^2 +  \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^4}
  \sum_i \left(\pd{J}{\alpha_i}\right)^2 \mu_4(\beta_i)
  \end{align*}
  For Gaussian (and all distributions which are symmetric about their
  mean), we have $\mu_3(\beta_i)=0$, and therefore: $$\text{SNR} =
  \frac{1}{N+1+n_b},$$ where $n_b$ is the contribution from errors in
  the baseline estimate $b$: $$n_b =
  \frac{\sigma^2_{\tilde{b}}}{\sigma_\beta^2 \sum_i
  \left( \pd{J}{\alpha_i} \right)^2}.$$ For uniform, we have $$\text{SNR} =
  \frac{1}{N-\frac{1}{5} +n_b}.$$
  \end{solution}
  \end{ex}

  \begin{ex}[Weight perturbation - optimal noise calculations]
  \label{p:optimal_noise}
  Use a second-order Taylor expansion...
  $$y(\balpha + \bbeta) = y(\balpha) + \pd{J}{\balpha} \bbeta + \frac{1}{2}\bbeta^T {\bf h} \bbeta,$$
  where ${\bf h}$ is the Hermitian of the function evaluated at $\balpha$:
  $${\bf h} = \pd{}{\balpha} \left[ \pd{J}{\balpha}^T \right] = \begin{bmatrix}
  \pd{^2 y}{\alpha_1 \partial \alpha_1} & \cdots & \pd{^2 y}{\alpha_1 \partial \alpha_N} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \pd{^2 y}{\alpha_N \partial \alpha_1} & \cdots &
  \pd{^2 y}{\alpha_N \partial \alpha_N} \end{bmatrix}.$$
  You may assume that the distribution on $\beta_i$ is symmetric about the
  mean, which zeros all odd central-moments starting at $\mu_3(\beta_i) = 0$.

  \begin{solution}
  \begin{align*}
  \avg{\Delta\balpha} \approx& -\frac{\eta}{\sigma_\beta^2} \avg{ \left[ \tilde{b} +
  \pd{J}{\balpha}\bbeta + \frac{1}{2} \bbeta^T {\bf h} \bbeta \right] \bbeta } \\
  =& - \eta \pd{J}{\balpha}^T + \sum_i \mu_3(\beta_i) h_{ii} = -\eta \pd{J}{\balpha}^T
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align*}
  \avg{\Delta \balpha^T \Delta \balpha} \approx& \frac{\eta^2}{\sigma_\beta^4}
  \avg{ \left[ \tilde{b} + \pd{J}{\balpha}\bbeta + \frac{1}{2}\bbeta^T {\bf h} \bbeta \right]^2 \bbeta^T
  \bbeta }
  \end{align*}
  This introduces a number of new terms to the soln from problem
  \ref{p:snr_baseline}:
  \begin{align*}
  \tilde{b} ( \bbeta^T {\bf h} \bbeta ) \bbeta^T \bbeta =&
  \tilde{b} \sum_{i,j,k} h_{ij} \avg{\beta_i \beta_j \beta_k^2} \\
  =& \tilde{b} \left[ \sigma_\beta^4 (N-1) \sum_i h_{ii} + \sum_i h_{ii}
  \mu_4(\beta_i) \right]
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align*}
  (\pd{J}{\balpha} \bbeta ) (\bbeta^T {\bf h} \bbeta) ) \bbeta^T \bbeta =&
  \sum_{i,j,k,l} \pd{J}{\alpha_i} h_{jk} \avg{\beta_i \beta_j \beta_k \beta_l^2} = 0
  \end{align*}
  because $$ \avg{\beta_i \beta_j \beta_k \beta_l^2} = \begin{cases} 0 & i \neq j, \text{ or } i
  \neq k, \text{ or } j \neq k
  \\ \mu_3(\beta_i) \mu_2(\beta_i) & i=j=k \neq l \\
  \mu_5(\beta_i) & i=j=k=l. \end{cases}$$
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{4}(\bbeta^T {\bf h} \bbeta) (\bbeta^T {\bf h} \bbeta)
  \bbeta^T \bbeta =&
  \sum_{i,j,k,l,m} h_{ij} h_{kl} \avg{\beta_i \beta_j \beta_k \beta_l \beta_m^2} \\ =&
  \sigma_\beta^6 (N-2) \sum_{i,j \neq i} (h_{ii}h_{jj} + 2h_{ij}^2) +
  \sigma_\beta^2 \mu_4(\beta_i) \left[ (N-1)\sum_i h_{ii}^2 + \sum_{i,j \neq i}  (2h_{ii}h_{jj}
  + 2h_{ij}^2) \right]
  \end{align*}
  because $$\avg{\beta_i \beta_j \beta_k \beta_l \beta_m^2} = \begin{cases} \sigma_\beta^6 &
  \text{three distinct pairs} \\ \sigma_\beta^2 \mu_4(\beta_i) & \text{two
  pairs} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}$$
  yuck!
