  <p>I've argued that optimal control is a powerful framework for specifying
  complex behaviors with simple objective functions, letting the dynamics and
  constraints on the system shape the resulting feedback controller (and vice
  versa!). But the computational tools that we've provided so far have been
  limited in some important ways.  The numerical approaches to dynamic
  programming which involve putting a mesh over the state space do not scale
  well to systems with state dimension more than four or five.  Linearization
  around a nominal operating point (or trajectory) allowed us to solve for
  locally optimal control policies (e.g. using LQR) for even very
  high-dimensional systems, but the effectiveness of the resulting controllers
  is limited to the region of state space where the linearization is a good
  approximation of the nonlinear dynamics.  The computational tools for Lyapunov
  analysis from the last chapter can provide, among other things, an effective
  way to compute estimates of those regions.  But we have not yet provided any
  real computational tools for approximate optimal control that work for
  high-dimensional systems beyond the linearization around a goal. That is
  precisely the goal for this chapter.</p>

  <p>In order to scale to high-dimensional systems, we are going to formulate a
  simpler version of the optimization problem.  Rather than trying to solve for
  the optimal feedback controller for the entire state space, in this chapter
  we will instead attempt to find an optimal control solution that is valid
  from only a single initial condition. Instead of representing this as a
  feedback control function, we can represent this solution as a
  <em>trajectory</em>, $\bx(t), \bu(t)$, typically defined over a finite
  interval.</p>

  <section><h1>Problem Formulation</h1>

    <p>Given an initial condition, $\bx_0$, and an input trajectory $\bu(t)$
    defined over a finite interval, $t\in[t_0,t_f],$   we can compute the
    long-term (finite-horizon) cost of executing that trajectory   using the
    standard additive-cost optimal control objective, \[ J_{\bu(\cdot)}(\bx_0) =
    \ell_f (\bx(t_f)) + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \ell(\bx(t),\bu(t)) dt. \]  We will
    write the trajectory optimization problem as \begin{align*}
    \min_{\bu(\cdot)} \quad & \ell_f (\bx(t_f)) + \int_{t_0}^{t_f}
    \ell(\bx(t),\bu(t)) dt \\ \subjto \quad & \dot{\bx}(t) = f(\bx(t),\bu(t)),
    \quad \forall t\in[t_0, t_f] \\ & \bx(t_0) = \bx_0. \\ \end{align*} Some
    trajectory optimization problems may also include additional constraints,
    such as collision avoidance (e.g., where the constraint is that the signed
    distance between the robot's geometry and the obstacles stays positive) or
    input limits (e.g. $\bu_{min} \le \bu \le \bu_{max}$ ), which can be defined
    for all time or some subset of the trajectory.</p>

    <p> As written, the optimization above is an optimization over continuous
    trajectories.  In order to formulate this as a numerical optimization, we
    must parameterize it with a finite set of numbers.  Perhaps not
    surprisingly, there are many different ways to write down this
    parameterization, with a variety of different properties in terms of speed,
    robustness, and accuracy of the results. We will outline just a few of the
    most popular below; I would recommend <elib>Betts98+Betts01</elib> for
    additional details.</p>

    <p>It is worth contrasting this parameterization problem with the one that
    we faced in our continuous-dynamic programming algorithms.  For trajectory
    optimization, we need a finite-dimensional parameterization in only one
    dimension (time), whereas in the mesh-based value iteration algorithms we
    had to work in the dimension of the state space.  Our mesh-based
    discretizations scaled badly with this state dimension, and led to
    numerical errors that were difficult to deal with.  There is relatively
    much more known about discretizing solutions to differential equations over
    time, including work on error-controlled integration.  And the number of
    parameters required for trajectory parameterizations scales linearly with
    the state dimension, instead of exponentially in mesh-based value
    iteration.</p>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Convex Formulations for Linear Systems</h1>

    <p>Let us first consider the case of linear systems.  In fact, if we start
    in discrete time, we can even defer the question of how to best discretize
    the continuous-time problem.  There are a few different ways that we might
    "transcribe" this optimization problem into a concrete mathematical
    program.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Direct Transcription</h1>

      <p>For instance, let us start by writing both $\bu[\cdot]$ and
      $\bx[\cdot]$ as decision variables. Then we can write: \begin{align*}
      \min_{\bx[\cdot],\bu[\cdot]} \quad & \ell_f(\bx[N]) + \sum_{n_0}^{N-1}
      \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]) \\ \subjto \quad & \bx[n+1] = {\bf A}\bx[n] + {\bf
      B}\bu[n], \quad \forall n\in[0, N-1] \\ & \bx[0] = \bx_0 \\ & +
      \text{additional constraints}. \end{align*}  We call this modeling choice
      -- adding $\bx[\cdot]$ as decision variables and modeling the discrete
      dynamics as explicit constraints -- the "<i>direct transcription</i>".
      Importantly, for linear systems, the dynamics constraints are linear
      constraints in these decision variables.  As a result, if we can restrict
      our additional constraints to linear inequality constraints and our
      objective function to being linear/quadratic in $\bx$ and $\bu$, then the
      resulting trajectory optimization is a convex optimization (specifically a
      linear program or quadratic program depending on the objective).  As a
      result, we can reliably solve these problems to global optimality at quite
      large scale; these days it is common to solve these optimization online
      inside a high-rate feedback controller.</p>

      <example><h1>Trajectory optimization for the Double Integrator</h1>

        <p>We've looked at a few optimal control problems for the double
        integrator using value iteration. For one of them -- the quadratic
        objective with no constraints on $\bu$ -- we know now that we could have
        solved the problem "exactly" using LQR. But we have not yet given
        satisfying numerical solutions for the minimum-time problem, nor for the
        constrained LQR problem.</p>

        <p>In the trajectory formulation, we can solve these problems exactly
        for the discrete-time double integrator, and with better accuracy for
        the continuous-time double integrator.  Take a moment to appreciate
        that!  The bang-bang policy and cost-to-go functions are fairly
        nontrivial functions of state; it's quite satisfying that we can
        evaluate them using convex optimization!  The limitation, of course, is
        that we are only solving them for one initial condition at a time.</p>

        <p><a target="trajopt"
          href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/trajopt.ipynb#scrollTo=fhc5mrE9_V81"><img
          src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"
          alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
            </p>

      </example>

      <p>If you have not studied convex optimization before, you might be
      surprised by the modeling power of even of this framework.  Consider, for
      instance, an objective of the form $$\ell(\bx,\bu) = |\bx| + |\bu|.$$
      This can be formulated as a linear program.  To do it, add additional
      decision variables ${\bf s}_x[\cdot]$ and ${\bf s}_u[\cdot]$ -- these are
      commonly referred to as <i>slack variables</i>
      -- and write $$\min_{\bx,\bu,{\bf s}_x,{\bf s}_u} \sum_n^{N-1} {\bf
      s}_x[n] + {\bf s}_u[n], \quad \text{s.t.} \quad {\bf s}_x[n] \ge x[n],
      \quad {\bf s}_x[n] \ge -x[n], \quad ...$$  The field of convex
      optimization is replete with tricks like this.  Knowing and recognizing
      them are skills of the (optimization) trade.  But there are also many
      relevant constraints which cannot be recast into convex constraints (in
      the original coordinates) with any amount of skill.  An important example
      is obstacle avoidance.  Imagine a vehicle that must decide if it should
      go left or right around an obstacle.  This represents a fundamentally
      non-convex constraint in $\bx$; we'll discuss the implications of using
      non-convex optimization for trajectory optimization below.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection id="direct_shooting"><h1>Direct Shooting</h1>

      <p>The savvy reader might have noticed that adding $\bx[\cdot]$ as
      decision variables was not strictly necessary.  If we know $\bx[0]$ and
      we know $\bu[\cdot]$, then we should be able to solve for $\bx[n]$ using
      forward simulation.  For our discrete-time linear systems, this is
      particularly nice: \begin{align*}\bx[1] =& {\bf A}\bx[0] + {\bf B}\bu[0]
      \\ \bx[2] =& {\bf A}({\bf A}\bx[0] + {\bf B}\bu[0]) + {\bf B}\bu[1] \\
      \bx[n] =& {\bf A}^n\bx[0] + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} {\bf A}^{n-1-k}{\bf
      B}u[k].\end{align*}  What's more, the solution is still linear in
      $\bu[\cdot]$.  This is amazing... we can get rid of a bunch of decision
      variables, and turn a constrained optimization problem into an
      unconstrained optimization problem (assuming we don't have any other
      constraints).  This approach -- using $\bu[\cdot]$ but <i>not</i>
      $\bx[\cdot]$ as decision variables and using forward simulation to obtain
      $\bx[n]$ -- is called the <i>direct shooting</i> transcription.  For
      linear systems with linear/quadratic objectives in $\bx$, and $\bu$, it
      is still a convex optimization, and has less decision variables and
      constraints than the direct transcription.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection id="computational_considerations"><h1>Computational
    Considerations</h1></subsection>

      <p>So is direct shooting uniformly better than the direct transcription
      approach?  I think it is not.  There are a few potential reason that one
      might prefer the direct transcription: <ul><li>Numerical conditioning.
      Shooting involves calculating ${\bf A}^n$ for potentially large $n$,
      which can lead to a large range of coefficient values in the constraints.
      This problem (sometimes referred to as the "tail wagging the dog") is
      somewhat fundamental in trajectory optimization: the control input
      $\bu[0]$ really does have more opportunity to have a large impact on the
      total cost than control input $\bu[N-1]$.  But the direct transcription
      approach combats the numerical issue by spreading this effect out over a
      large number of well-balanced constraints.</li><li>Adding state
      constraints.  Having $\bx[n]$ as explicit decision variables makes it
      very easy/natural to add additional state constraints; and the solver
      effectively reuses the computation of ${\bf A}^n$ for each constraint.
      In shooting, one has to unroll those terms for each new
      constraint.</li><li>Parallelization.  For larger problems, evaluating the
      constraints can be a substantial cost.  In direct transcription, one can
      evaluate the dynamics/constraints in parallel (because each iteration
      begins with $\bx[n]$ already given), whereas shooting is more
      fundamentally a serial operation.</li></ul></p>

      <p>For linear convex problems, the solvers are mature enough that these
      differences often don't amount to much.  For nonlinear optimization
      problems, the differences can be substantial.  If you look at trajectory
      optimization papers in mainstream robotics, you will see that both direct
      transcription and direct shooting approaches are used. (It's possible you
      could guess which research lab wrote the paper simply by the
      transcription they use!)</p>

      <p>It is also worth noting that the problems generated by the direct
      transcription have an important and exploitable "banded" sparsity pattern
      -- most of the constraints touch only a small number of variables.  This
      is actually the same pattern that we exploit in the Riccati equations.
      Thanks to the importance of these methods in real applications, numerous
      specialized solvers have been written to explicitly exploit this sparsity
      (e.g. <elib>Wang09a</elib>).</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Continuous Time</h1>

      <p>If we wish to solve the continuous-time version of the problem, then we
      can discretize time and use the formulations above.  The most important
      decision is the discretization / numerical integration scheme.  For linear
      systems, if we assume that the control inputs are held constant for each
      time step (aka <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-order_hold">zero-order hold</a>),
      then we can integrate the dynamics perfectly: $$\bx[n+1] = \bx[n] +
      \int_{t_n}^{t_n + h} \left[ {\bf A} \bx(t) + {\bf B}\bu \right]dt =
      e^{{\bf A}h}\bx[n] + {\bf A}^{-1}(e^{{\bf A}h} - {\bf I}){\bf B}\bu[n],$$
      is the simple case (when ${\bf A}$ is invertible). But in general, we can
      use any finitely-parameterized representation of $\bu(t)$ and any
      numerical integration scheme to obtain $\bx[n+1]={\bf f}(\bx[n],
      \bu[n])$.</p>

    </subsection>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Nonconvex Trajectory Optimization</h1>

    <p>I strongly recommend that you study the convex trajectory optimization
    case; it can lead you to mental clarity and sense of purpose.  But in
    practice trajectory optimization is often used to solve nonconvex problems.
    Our formulation can become nonconvex for a number of reasons.  For example,
    if the dynamics are nonlinear, then the dynamic constraints become
    nonconvex.  You may also wish to have a nonconvex objective or nonconvex
    additional constraint (e.g. collision avoidance). Typically we formulate
    these problems using tools from <a
    href="optimization.html#nonlinear">nonlinear programming</a>.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Direct Transcription and Direct Shooting</h1>

      <p>The formulations that we wrote for direct transcription and direct
      shooting above are still valid when the dynamics are nonlinear, it's just
      that the resulting problem is nonconvex.  For instance, the direct
      transcription for discrete-time systems becomes the more general:
      \begin{align*} \min_{\bx[\cdot],\bu[\cdot]} \quad & \ell_f(\bx[N]) +
      \sum_{n_0}^{N-1} \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]) \\ \subjto \quad & \bx[n+1] = {\bf
      f}(\bx[n], \bu[n]), \quad \forall n\in[0, N-1] \\ & \bx[0] = \bx_0 \\ & +
      \text{additional constraints}. \end{align*}  Direct shooting still works,
      too, since on each iteration of the algorithm we can compute $\bx[n]$
      given $\bx[0]$ and $\bu[\cdot]$ by forward simulation.  But things get a
      bit more interesting when we consider continuous-time systems.</p>

      <p>For nonlinear dynamics, we have many choices for how to approximate
      the discrete dynamics $$\bx[n+1] = \bx[n] + \int_{t[n]}^{t[n+1]}
      f(\bx(t), \bu(t)) dt, \quad \bx(t[n]) = \bx[n].$$  For instance, in
      <drake></drake>
      we have an entire <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__integrators.html">suite of
      numerical integrators</a> that achieve different levels of simulation
      speed and/or accuracy, both of which can be highly dependent on the
      details of ${\bf f}(\bx,\bu)$.</p>

      <todo>Finish supporting IntegratorBase in DirectTranscription and write an
      example showing how to use it here.</todo>

      <p>One very important idea in numerical integration of differential
      equations is the use of variable-step integration as a means for
      controlling integration error.  <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#Adaptive_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods">Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg</a>,
      also known as "RK45", is one of the most famous variable-step
      integrators.  We typically avoid using variable steps inside a constraint
      (it can lead to discontinuous gradients), but it is possible to
      accomplish something similar in trajectory optimization by allowing the
      sample times, $t[\cdot]$, themselves to be decision variables.  This
      allows the optimizer to stretch or shrink the time intervals in order to
      solve the problem, and is particularly useful if you do not know apriori
      what the total duration of the trajectory should be.  Adding some
      constraints to these time variables is essential in order to avoid
      trivial solutions (like collapsing to a trajectory of zero duration). One
      could potentially even add constraints to bound the integration
      error.</p>

    </subsection> <!-- end dirtran -->

    <subsection id="direct_collocation"><h1>Direct Collocation</h1>

      <p>It is very satisfying to have a suite of numerical integration routines
      available for our direct transcription.  But numerical integrators are
      designed to solve forward in time, and this represents a design constraint
      that we don't actually have in our direct transcription formulation.  If
      our goal is to obtain an accurate solution to the differential equation
      with a small number of function evaluations / decision variables /
      constraints, then some new formulations are possible that take advantage
      of the constrained optimization formulation.  These include the
      so-called <em>collocation methods</em>.</p>

      <p> In direct collocation (c.f., <elib>Hargraves87</elib>), both the
      input trajectory and the state trajectory are represented explicitly as
      piecewise polynomial functions.  In particular, the sweet spot for this
      algorithm is taking $\bu(t)$ to be a first-order polynomial and $\bx(t)$
      to be a cubic polynomial.</p>

      <p>It turns out that in this sweet spot, the only decision variables we
      need in our optimization are the sample values $\bu(t)$ and $\bx(t)$ at
      the so called "break" points of the spline.  You might think that you
      would need the coefficients of the cubic spline parameters, but you do
      not.  For the first-order interpolation on $\bu(t)$, given $\bu(t_k)$ and
      $\bu(t_{k+1})$, we can solve for every value $\bu(t)$ over the interval
      $t \in [k, k+1]$.  But we also have everything that we need for the cubic
      spline: given $\bx(t_k)$ and $\bu(t_k),$ we can compute $\dot\bx(t_k) = f
      (\bx(t_k), \bu(t_k))$; and the four values $\bx(t_k), \bx(t_{k+1}),
      \dot\bx (t_k), \dot\bx(t_{k+1})$ completely define all of the parameters
      of the cubic spline over the interval $t\in[t_k, t_{k+1}]$.  This is very
      convenient, because it is easy for us to add additional constraints to
      $\bu$ and $\bx$ at the sample points (and would have been relatively
      harder to have to convert every constraint into constraints on the spline
      coefficients).</p>

      <figure>
        <img width="80%" src="data/collocation.svg">
        <figcaption>Cubic spline parameters used in the direct collocation method.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>It turns out that we need one more constraint per time segment to
      enforce the dynamics and to fully specify the trajectory.  In direct
      collocation, we add a derivative constraint at the so-called
      <i>collocation points</i>.  In particular, if we choose the collocation
      points to be the midpoints of the spline, then we have that
      \begin{gather*} t_{c,k} = \frac{1}{2}\left(t_k + t_{k+1}\right), \qquad
      h_k = t_{k+1} - t_k, \\ \bu(t_{c,k}) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\bu(t_k) +
      \bu(t_{k+1})\right), \\ \bx(t_{c,k}) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\bx(t_k) +
      \bx(t_{k+1})\right) + \frac{h}{8} \left(\dot\bx(t_k) -
      \dot\bx(t_{k+1})\right), \\ \dot\bx(t_{c,k}) =
      -\frac{3}{2h}\left(\bx(t_k) - \bx(t_{k+1})\right) - \frac{1}{4}
      \left(\dot\bx(t_k) + \dot\bx(t_{k+1})\right). \end{gather*} These
      equations come directly from the equations that fit the cubic spline to
      the end points/derivatives then interpolate them at the midpoint.  They
      give us precisely what we need to add the dynamics constraint to our
      optimization at the collocation points:\begin{align*}
      \min_{\bx[\cdot],\bu[\cdot]} \quad & \ell_f(\bx[N]) + \sum_{n_0}^{N-1}
      h_n \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]) \\ \subjto \quad & \dot\bx(t_{c,n}) =
      f(\bx(t_{c,n}), \bu(t_{c,n})), & \forall n \in [0,N-1]  \\ & \bx[0] =
      \bx_0 \\ & + \text{additional constraints}. \end{align*}  I hope this
      notation is clear -- I'm using $\bx[k] = \bx(t_k)$ as the decision
      variables, and the collocation constraint at $t_{c,k}$ depends on the
      decision variables: $\bx[k], \bx[k+1], \bu[k], \bu[k+1]$. The actual
      equations of motion get evaluated at both the break points, $t_k$, and
      the collocation points, $t_{c,k}$.</p>

      <p>Once again, direct collocation effectively integrates the equations of
      motion by satisfying the constraints of the optimization -- this time
      producing an integration of the dynamics that is accurate to third-order
      with effectively two evaluations of the plant dynamics per segment (since
      we use $\dot\bx(t_k)$ for two intervals). <elib>Hargraves87</elib>
      claims, without proof, that as the break points are brought closer
      together, the trajectory will converge to a true solution of the
      differential equation. Once again it is very natural to add additional
      terms to the cost function or additional input/state constraints, and
      very easy to calculate the gradients of the objective and constraints.
      I personally find it very nice to explicitly account for the parametric
      encoding of the trajectory in the solution technique.</p>

    <subsection id="pseudo-spectral"><h1>Pseudo-spectral Methods</h1>

      <p>The direct collocation method of <elib>Hargraves87</elib> was our first
      example of explicitly representing the solution of the optimal control
      problem as a parameterized trajectory, and adding constraints to the
      derivatives at a series of collocation points.  In the algorithm above,
      the representation of choice was <i>piecewise-polynomials</i>, e.g. cubic
      spines, and the spline coefficients were the decision variables.  A
      closely related approach, often called "pseudo-spectral" optimal control,
      uses the same collocation idea, but represents the trajectories instead
      using a linear combination of <i>global, polynomial</i> basis functions.
      These methods use typically much higher-degree polynomials, but can
      leverage clever parameterizations to write sparse collocation objectives
      and to select the collocation points <elib>Garg11+Ross12a</elib>.
      Interestingly, The continuously-differentiable nature of the
      representation of these methods has led to comparatively more theorems and
      analysis than we have seen for other direct trajectory optimization
      methods <elib>Ross12a</elib> -- but despite some of the language used in
      these articles please remember they are still local optimization methods
      trying to solve a nonconvex optimization problem.  While the direct
      collocation method above might be expected to converge to the true optimal
      solution by adding more segments to the piecewise polynomial (and having
      each segment represent a smaller interval of time), here we expect
      convergence to happen as we increase the degree of the polynomials.</p>

      <p>The pseudo-spectral methods are also sometimes knowns as "orthogonal
      collocation" because the $N$ basis polynomials, $\phi_j(t)$, are chosen so
      that at the $N$th collocation point $t_j$, we have $$\phi_i(t_j) =
      \begin{cases} 1 & i=j, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$  This can be
      accomplished by choosing $$\phi_j(t) = \prod_{i=0, i\ne j}^{N}
      \frac{t-t_i}{t_j - t_i}.$$  Note that for both numerical reasons and for
      analysis, time is traditionally rescaled from the interval $[t_0, t_f]$ to
      $[-1, 1]$.  Collocation points are chosen based on small variations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature"></a>Gaussian quadrature</a>, known as the "Gauss-Lobatto" which includes collocation points at $t=-1$ and $t=1$.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, a number of papers have also infinite-horizon
      pseudo-spectral optimization by the nonlinear rescaling of the time
      interval $t\in[0, \infty)$ to the half-open interval $\tau\in[-1, 1)$ via
      $\tau = \frac{t-1}{t+1}$ <elib>Garg11+Ross12a</elib>.  In this case, one
      chooses the collocation times so that they include $\tau = -1$ but do not
      include $\tau=1$, using the so-called "Gauss-Radau" points
      <elib>Garg11</elib>.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Dynamic constraints in implicit form</h1>

        <p>There is another, seemingly subtle but potentially important,
        opportunity that can be exploited in a few of these transcriptions, if
        our main interest is in optimizing systems with significant multibody
        dynamics.  In some cases, we can actually write the dynamics constraints
        directly in their implicit form.  We've <a
        href="lyapunov.html#ex:implicit">introduced this idea already</a> in the
        context of Lyapunov analysis.  In many cases, it is nicer or more
        efficient to obtain the equations of motion in an implicit form, ${\bf
        g}(\bx,\bu,\dot\bx) = 0$, and to avoid ever having to solve for the
        explicit form $\dot\bx = {\bf f}(\bx,\bu).$  This can become even more
        important when we consider systems for which the explicit form doesn't
        have a unique solution -- we will see examples of this when we study
        trajectory optimization through contact because the Coulomb model for
        friction actually results in a differential inclusion instead of a
        differential equation.</p>

        <p>The collocation methods, which operate on the dynamic constraints at
        collocation points directly in their continuous form, can use the
        implicit form directly.  It is possible to write a time-stepping
        (discrete-time approximation) for direct transcription using implicit
        integrators -- again providing constraints in implicit form.  The
        implicit form is harder to exploit in the shooting methods.</p>

        <todo>There should really be better versions of direct transcription and
        the collocation methods that are specialized for second-order systems.
        We should only have $\bq$ as a decision variable, and be able to impose
        the dynamics only on the second derivatives (the first derivatives are
        consistent by construction).  This is one of the main talking points in
        DMOC, even though the emphasis is on the discrete mechanics.</todo>

      </subsubsection>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Solution techniques</h1>

      <p>The different transcriptions presented above represent different ways
      to map the (potentially continuous-time) optimal control problem into a
      finite set of decision variables, objectives, and constraints.  But even
      once that choice is made, there are numerous approaches to solving this
      optimization problem.  Any general approach to <a
      href="optimization.html#nonlinear">nonlinear programming</a>
      can be applied here; in the python examples we've included so far, the
      problems are handed directly to the sequential-quadratic programming (SQP)
      solver SNOPT, or to the interior-point solver IPOPT.</p>

      <p>There is also quite a bit of exploitable problem-specific structure in
      these trajectory optimization problems due to the sequential nature of the
      problem. As a result, there are some ideas that are fairly specific to the
      trajectory optimization formulation of optimal control, and customized
      solvers can often (and sometimes dramatically) outperform general purpose
      solvers.</p>

      <p>This trajectory-optimization structure is easiest to discuss, and
      implement, in unconstrained formulations, so we will start there. In fact,
      in recent years we have seen a surge in popularity in robotics for doing
      trajectory optimization using (often special-purpose) solvers for
      unconstrained trajectory optimization, where the constrained problems are
      transformed into unconstrained problem via <a
      href="optimization.html#penalty">penalty methods</a>.  I would say penalty
      methods based on the augmented Lagrangian are particularly popular for
      trajectory optimization these days <elib>Lin91+Toussaint14</elib>.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Efficiently computing gradients</h1>

        <p>Providing gradients of the objectives and constraints to the solver
        is not strictly required -- most solvers will obtain them from finite
        differences if they are not provided -- but I feel strongly that the
        solvers are faster and more robust when exact gradients are provided.
        Providing the gradients for the direct transcription methods is very
        straight-forward -- we simply provide the gradients for each constraint
        individually.  But in the direct shooting approach, where we have
        removed the $\bx$ decision variables from the program but still write
        objectives and constraints in terms of $\bx$, it would become very
        inefficient to compute the gradients of each objective/constraint
        independently.  We need to leverage the chain rule.</p>

        <p>To be concise (and slightly more general),   let us define
        $\bx[n+1]=f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n])$ as the discrete-time approximation of the
        continuous dynamics; for example, the forward Euler integration scheme
        used above would give $f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n]) = \bx[n]+f(\bx[n],\bu[n])dt.$
        Then we have \[\pd{J}{\bu_k} = \pd{\ell_f(\bx[N])}{\bu_k} +
        \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \left(\pd{\ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bx[n]}
        \pd{\bx[n]}{\bu_k} + \pd{\ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bu_k} \right), \]   where
        the gradient of the state with respect to the inputs can be computed
        during the "forward simulation",   \[ \pd{\bx[n+1]}{\bu_k} =
        \pd{f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bx[n]} \pd{\bx[n]}{\bu_k} +
        \pd{f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bu_k}.  \]   These simulation gradients can
        also be used in the chain rule to provide the gradients of any
        constraints.  Note that there are a lot of terms to keep around here, on
        the order of (state dim) $\times$ (control dim) $\times$ (number of
        timesteps).   Ouch.  Note also that many of these terms are zero; for
        instance with the Euler integration scheme above $\pd{\bu[n]}{\bu_k} =
        0$ if $k\ne n$.  (If this looks like I'm mixing two notations here,
        recall that I'm using $\bu_k$ to represent the decision variable and
        $\bu[n]$ to represent the input used in the $n$th step of the
        simulation.)</p>

      </subsubsection>  <!-- gradients -->

      <subsubsection><h1>The special case of direct shooting without state
      constraints</h1>

        <p>By solving for $\bx(\cdot)$ ourselves, we've removed a large number
        of constraints from the optimization.  If no additional state
        constraints are present, and the only gradients we need to compute are
        the gradients of the objective, then a surprisingly efficient algorithm
        emerges.  I'll give the steps here without derivation, but will derive
        it in the Pontryagin section below: <ol> <li>Simulate forward:
        $$\bx[n+1] = f_d(\bx[n],\bu_n),$$ from  $\bx[0] = \bx_0$.</li>
        <li>Calculate backwards: $$\lambda[n-1] =
        \pd{\ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bx[n]}^T + \pd{f(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bx[n]}^T
        \lambda[n],$$ from $\lambda[N-1]=\pd{\ell_f(\bx[N])}{\bx[N]}$.</li>
        <li>Extract the gradients: $$\pd{J}{\bu[n]} =
        \pd{\ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bu[n]} + \lambda[n]^T
        \pd{f(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bu[n]},$$ with $\pd{J}{\bu_k} = \sum_n
        \pd{J}{\bu[n]}\pd{\bu[n]}{\bu_k}$.</li> </ol> <p>Here $\lambda[n]$ is a
        vector the same size as $\bx[n]$ which has an interpretation as
        $\lambda[n]=\pd{J}{\bx[n+1]}^T$.  The equation governing $\lambda$ is
        known as the <em>adjoint equation</em>, and it represents a dramatic
        efficiency improvement over calculating the huge number of simulation
        gradients described above. In case you are interested, yes the adjoint
        equation is exactly the <em>backpropagation algorithm</em> that is
        famous in the neural networks literature, or more generally a bespoke
        version of reverse-mode <a

      <subsubsection><h1>Getting good solutions... in practice.</h1>

        <p>As you begin to play with these algorithms on your own problems, you might feel like you're on an emotional roller-coaster.  You will have moments of incredible happiness -- the solver may find very impressive solutions to highly nontrivial problems.  But you will also have moments of frustration, where the solver returns an awful solution, or simply refuses to return a solution (saying "infeasible").  The frustrating thing is, you cannot distinguish between a problem that is actually infeasible, vs. the case where the solver was simply stuck in a local minima.</p>

        <p>So the next phase of your journey is to start trying to "help" the solver along.  There are two common approaches.</p>

        <p>The first is tuning your cost function -- some people spend a lot of time adding new elements to the objective or adjusting the relative weight of the different components of the objective.  This is a slippery slope, and I tend to try to avoid it (possibly to a fault; other groups tend to put out more compelling videos!).</p>

        <p>The second approach is to give a better initial guess to your solver
        to put it in the vicinity of the "right" local minimal.  I find this
        approach more satisfying, because for most problems I think there really
        is a "correct" formulation for the objective and constraints, and we
        should just aim to find the optimal solution.  Once again, we do see a
        difference here between the direct shooting algorithms and the direct
        transcription / collocation algorithms.  For shooting, we can only
        provide the solver with an initial guess for $\bu(\cdot)$, whereas the
        other methods allow us to also specify an initial guess for $\bx(\cdot)$
        directly.  I find that this can help substantially, even with very
        simple initializations.  In the direct collocation examples for the
        swing-up problem of the Acrobot and cart-pole, simply providing the
        initial guess for $\bx(\cdot)$ as a straight line trajectory between the
        start and the goal was enough to help the solver find a good solution;
        in fact it was necessary.</p>

  <section><h1>Local Trajectory Feedback Design</h1>

    <p>Once we have obtained a locally optimal trajectory from trajectory
    optimization, we have found an open-loop trajectory that (at least locally)
    minimizes our optimal control cost.  Up to numerical tolerances, this pair
    $\bu_0(t), \bx_0(t)$ represents a feasible solution trajectory of the
    system.  But we haven't done anything, yet, to ensure that this trajectory
    is locally stable.</p>

    <p>In fact, there are a few notable approximations that we've already made
    to get to this point: the integration accuracy of our trajectory
    optimization tends to be much less than the accuracy used during forward
    simulation (we tend to take bigger time steps during optimization to avoid
    adding too many decision variables), and the default convergence tolerance
    from the optimization toolboxes tend to satisfy the dynamic constraints
    only to around $10^{-6}$.  As a result, if you were to simulate the
    optimized control trajectory directly <i>even from the exact initial
    conditions</i> used in / obtained from trajectory optimization, you might
    find that the state trajectory diverges from your planned trajectory.</p>

    <p>There are a number of things we can do about this.  It is possible to
    evaluate the local stability of the trajectory during the trajectory
    optimization, and add a cost or constraint that rewards open-loop stability
    (e.g. <elib>Mombaur05+Johnson16</elib>).  This can be very effective
    (though it does tend to be expensive).  But open-loop stability is a quite
    restrictive notion.  A potentially more generally useful approach is to
    design a feedback controller to regulate the system back to the planned
    trajectory.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Finite-horizon LQR</h1>

      <p>We have already developed on approach for <a
      href="lqr.html#finite_horizon_nonlinear">trajectory stabilization in the
      LQR chapter</a>.  This is one of my favorite approaches to trajectory
      feedback, because it provides a (numerically) closed-form solution for
      the controller, $\bK(t),$ and even comes with a time-varying quadratic
      cost-to-go function, $S(t),$ that can be used for Lyapunov analysis.</p>

      <p>The basic procedure is to create a time-varying linearization along
      the trajectory in the error coordinates:  $\bar\bx(t) = \bx(t) -
      \bx_0(t)$, $\bar\bu(t) = \bu(t)-\bu_0(t)$, and $\dot{\bar{\bx}}(t) = {\bf A}(t)\bar\bx(t) + {\bf B}(t)\bar\bu(t).$  This linearization uses
      all of the same gradients of the dynamics that we have been using in our
      trajectory optimization algorithms.  Once we have the time-varying
      linearization, then we can apply finite-horizon LQR (see the <a
      href="lqr.html#finite_horizon_nonlinear">LQR chapter</a>
      for the details).</p>

      <p>A major virtue of this approach is that we can proceed immediately to
      verifying the performance of the closed-loop system under the LQR policy.
      Specifically, we can apply the finite-time reachability analysis to
      obtain "funnels" that certify a desired notion of invariance --
      guaranteeing that trajectories which start near the planned trajectory
      will stay near the planned trajectory.  Please see the <a
      href="lyapunov.html#finite-time">finite-time reachability analysis</a>
      section for those details.  We will put all of these ideas together in
      the perching case-study below.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Model-Predictive Control</h1>

      <p>The maturity, robustness, and speed of solving trajectory optimization
      using convex optimization leads to a beautiful idea: if we can optimize
      trajectories quickly enough, then we can use our trajectory optimization
      as a feedback policy.  The recipe is simple: (1) measure the current
      state, (2) optimize a trajectory from the current state, (3) execute the
      first action from the optimized trajectory, (4) let the dynamics evolve
      for one step and repeat.  This recipe is known as <i>model-predictive
      control</i> (MPC). </p>

      <p>Despite the very computational nature of this controller (there is no
      closed-form representation of this policy; it is represented only
      implicitly as the solution of the optimization), there is a bounty of
      theoretical and algorithmic results on MPC
      <elib>Garcia89+Camacho13</elib>.  And there are a few core ideas that
      practitioners should really understand.</p>

      <p>One core idea is the concept of <i>receding-horizon</i> MPC. Since our
      trajectory optimization problems are formulated over a finite-horizon, we
      can think each optimization as reasoning about the next $N$ timesteps.  If
      our true objective is to optimize the performance over a horizon longer
      than $N$ (e.g. over the infinite horizon), then it is standard to continue
      solving for an $N$ step horizon on each evaluation of the controller.  In
      this sense, the total horizon under consideration continues to move
      forward in time (e.g. to recede).</p>

      <p>Some care must be taken in receding-horizon formulations because on
      each new step we are introducing new costs and constraints into the
      problem (the ones that would have been associated with time $N+1$ on the
      previous solve) -- it would be very bad to march forward in time solving
      convex optimization problems only to suddenly encounter a situation where
      the solver returns "infeasible!".  One can design MPC formulations that
      guarantee <i>recursive feasibility</i> -- e.g. guarantee that if a
      feasible solution is found at time $n$, then the solver will also find a
      feasible solution at time $n+1$.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the simplest mechanism for guaranteeing recursive feasibility
      in an optimization for stabilizing a fixed point, $(\bx^*, \bu^*)$, is to
      add a final-value constraint to the receding horizon, $\bx[N] = \bx^*$.
      This idea is simple but important. Considering the
      trajectories/constraints in absolute time, then on step $k$ of the
      algorithm, we are optimizing for $\bx[k], ... , \bx[k+N],$ and $\bu[k],
      ..., \bu[k+N-1]$; let us say that we have found a feasible solution for
      this problem. The danger in receding-horizon control is that when we shift
      to the next step ($k+1$) we introduce constraints on the system at
      $\bx[k+N+1]$ for the first time.  But if our feasible solution in step $k$
      had $\bx[k+N] = \bx^*$, then we know that setting $\bx[k+N+1] = \bx^*,
      \bu[k+N] = \bu^*$ is guaranteed to provide a feasible solution to the new
      optimization problem in step $k+1$.  With feasibility guaranteed, the
      solver is free to search for a lower-cost solution (which may be available
      now because we've shifted the final-value constraint further into the
      future). It is also possible to formulate MPC problems that guarantee
      recursive feasibility even in the presence of modeling errors and
      disturbances (c.f. <elib>Bemporad99</elib>).</p>

      <p>The theoretical and practical aspects of Linear MPC are so well
      understood today that it is considered the de-facto generalization of LQR
      for controlling a linear system subject to (linear) constraints.</p>

  <section id="perching"><h1>Case Study: A glider that can land on a perch
    like a bird</h1>

    <p>From 2008 til 2014, my group conducted a series of increasingly
    sophisticated investigations
    <elib>Cory08+Roberts09+Cory10a+Moore11a+Moore12+Moore14b</elib> which asked
    the question: can a fixed-wing UAV land on a perch like a bird?</p>

    <figure>
      <img width="80%" src="figures/perch-sequence.jpg">
      <figcaption>Basic setup for the glider landing on a perch.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>At the outset, this was a daunting task.  When birds land on a perch,
    they pitch up and expose their wings to an "angle-of-attack" that far
    exceeds the typical flight envelope.  Airplanes traditionally work hard to
    avoid this regime because it leads to aerodynamic "stall" -- a sudden loss
    of lift after the airflow separates from the wing.  But this loss of lift is
    also accompanied by a significant increase in drag, and birds exploit this
    when they rapidly decelerate to land on a perch.  Post-stall aerodynamics
    are a challenge for control because (1) the aerodynamics are time-varying
    (characterized by periodic vortex shedding) and nonlinear, (2) it is much
    harder to build accurate models of this flight regime, at least in a wind
    tunnel, and (3) stall implies a loss of attached flow on the wing and
    therefore on the control surfaces, so a potentially large reduction in
    control authority.</p>

    <p>We picked the project initially thinking that it would be a nice example
    for model-free control (like reinforcement learning -- since the models
    were unknown).  In the end, however, it turned out to be the project that
    really taught me about the power of model-based trajectory optimization and
    linear optimal control.  By conducting dynamic system identification
    experiments in a motion capture environment, we were able to fit both
    surprisingly simple models (based on flat-plate theory) to the
    dynamics<elib>Cory08</elib>, and also more accurate models using
    "neural-network-like" terms to capture the residuals between the model and
    the data <elib>Moore14b</elib>.  This made model-based control viable, but
    the dynamics were still complex -- while trajectory optimization should
    work, I was quite dubious about the potential for regulating to those
    trajectories with only linear feedback.</p>

    <p>I was wrong. Over and over again, I watched time-varying linear quadratic
    regulators take highly nontrivial corrective actions -- for instance,
    dipping down early in the trajectory to gain kinetic energy or tipping up to
    dump energy out of the system -- in order to land on the perch at the final
    time. Although the quality of the linear approximation of the dynamics did
    degrade the farther that we got from the nominal trajectory, the validity of
    the controller dropped off much less quickly (even as the vector field
    changed, the direction that the controller needed to push did not). This was
    also the thinking that got me initially so interested in understanding the
    regions of attraction of linear control on nonlinear systems.</p>

    <p>In the end, the experiments were very successful.  We started searching
    for the "simplest" aircraft that we could build that would capture the
    essential control dynamics, reduce complexity, and still accomplish the
    task.  We ended up building a series of flat-plate foam gliders (no
    propellor) with only a single actuator to control the elevator.  We added
    dihedral to the wings to help the aircraft stay in the longitudinal plane.
    The simplicity of these aircraft, plus the fact that they could be
    understood through the lens of quite simple models makes them one of my
    favorite canonical underactuated systems.</p>

        <figcaption>The flat-plate glider model.  Note that traditionally
        aircraft coordinates are chosen so that positive pitch brings the nose
        up; but this means that positive z is down (to have a right-handed
        system).  For consistency, I've chosen to stick with the vehicle
        coordinate system that we use throughout the text -- positive z is up,
        but positive pitch is down. </figcaption>

      <p>In our experiments, we found the dynamics of our aircraft were
      captured very well by the so-called "flat plate model"
      <elib>Cory08</elib>. In flat plate theory lift and drag forces of a wing
      are summarized by a single force at the center-of-pressure of the wing
      acting normal to the wing, with magnitude: $$f_n(S, {\bf n}, \bv) = \rho
      S \sin\alpha |\bv|^2 = -\rho S ({\bf n} \cdot \bv) |\bv|,$$ where $\rho$
      is the density of the air, $S$ is the area of the wing, $\alpha$ is the
      angle of attack of the surface, ${\bf n}$ is the normal vector of the
      lifting surface, and $\bv$ is the velocity of the center of pressure
      relative to the air.  This corresponds to having lift and drag
      coefficients $$c_{\text{lift}} = 2\sin\alpha\cos\alpha, \quad
      c_{\text{drag}} = 2\sin^2\alpha.$$ In our glider model, we summarize all
      of the aerodynamic forces by contributions of two lifting surfaces, the
      wing (including some contribution from the horizontal fuselage) denoted
      by subscript $w$ and the elevator denoted by subscript $e$, with centers
      at $\bp_w = [x_w, z_w]^T$ and $\bp_e = [x_e, z_e]^T$ given by the
      kinematics: $$\bp_w = \bp - l_w\begin{bmatrix} c_\theta \\ -s_\theta
      \end{bmatrix},\quad \bp_e = \bp - l_h \begin{bmatrix} c_\theta \\
      -s_\theta \end{bmatrix} - l_e \begin{bmatrix} c_{\theta+\phi} \\
      -s_{\theta+\phi} \end{bmatrix},$$ where the origin of our vehicle
      coordinate system, $\bp = [x,z]^T$, is chosen to be the center of mass.
      We assume still air, so $\bv = \dot{\bp}$ for both the wing and the
      elevator.  We assume that the elevator is massless, and the actuator
      controls velocity directly (note that this breaks our "control affine"
      structure, but is more realistic for the tiny hobby servos we were
      dealing with).  This gives us a total of 7 state variables $\bx = [x, z,
      \theta, \phi, \dot{x}, \dot{z}, \dot\theta]^T$ and one control input $\bu
      = \dot\phi.$ The resulting equations of motion are: \begin{gather*} {\bf
      n}_w = \begin{bmatrix} s_\theta \\ c_\theta \end{bmatrix}, \quad {\bf
      n}_e = \begin{bmatrix} s_{\theta+\phi} \\ c_{\theta+\phi} \end{bmatrix},
      \\ f_w = f_n(S_w, {\bf n}_w, \dot\bp_w), \quad f_e = f_n(S_e, {\bf n}_e,
      \dot\bp_e), \\ \ddot{x} = \frac{1}{m} \left(f_w s_\theta + f_e
      s_{\theta+\phi} \right), \\ \ddot{z} = \frac{1}{m} \left(f_w c_\theta +
      f_e c_{\theta+\phi} \right) - g, \\ \ddot\theta = \frac{1}{I} \left( l_w
      f_w + (l_h c_\phi + l_e) f_e \right). \end{gather*}
      <!-- Note: the inertia term looks suspicious, but is the result of a lot of cancellations in the cross product.  See, for instance, eq. 3.9 in Moore14b -->

  <section id="pontryagin"><h1>Pontryagin's Minimum Principle</h1>

    <p>The tools that we've been developing for numerical trajectory
    optimization are closely tied to theorems from (analytical) optimal control.
     Let us take one section to appreciate those connections.</p>

    <p>What precisely does it mean for a trajectory, $\bx(\cdot),\bu(\cdot)$, to
    be locally optimal?  It means that if I were to perturb that trajectory in
    any way (e.g. change $\bu_3$ by $\epsilon$), then I would either incur
    higher cost in my objective function or violate a constraint.  For an
    unconstrained optimization, a <em>necessary condition</em> for local
    optimality is that the gradient of the objective at the solution be exactly
    zero.  Of course the gradient can also vanish at local maxima or saddle
    points, but it certainly must vanish at local minima. We can generalize this
    argument to constrained optimization using <em>Lagrange multipliers</em>.
    </p>

    <todo>explain "direct" vs "indirect" methods somewhere in here.</todo>

    <subsection><h1>Lagrange multiplier derivation of the adjoint equations</h1>

      <p>Let us use Lagrange multipliers to derive the necessary conditions for
      our constrained trajectory optimization problem in discrete time
      \begin{align*} \min_{\bx[\cdot],\bu[\cdot]} & \ell_f(\bx[N]) +
      \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]),\\ \subjto \quad & \bx[n+1] =
      f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n]). \end{align*} Formulate the Lagrangian,
      \[L(\bx[\cdot],\bu[\cdot],\lambda[\cdot]) = \ell_f(\bx[N]) +
      \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ell(\bx[n],\bu[n]) + \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \lambda^T[n]
      \left(f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n]) - \bx[n+1]\right), \] and set the derivatives to
      zero to obtain the adjoint equation method described for the shooting
      algorithm above: \begin{gather*} \forall n\in[0,N-1], \pd{L}{\lambda[n]} =
      f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n]) - \bx[n+1] = 0 \Rightarrow \bx[n+1] = f(\bx[n],\bu[n])
      \\ \forall n\in[0,N-1], \pd{L}{\bx[n]} = \pd{\ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bx} +
      \lambda^T[n] \pd{f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bx} - \lambda^T[n-1] = 0 \\ \quad
      \Rightarrow \lambda[n-1] = \pd{\ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bx}^T +
      \pd{f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bx}^T \lambda[n]. \\ \pd{L}{\bx[N]} =
      \pd{\ell_f}{\bx}^T - \lambda^T[N-1] = 0 \Rightarrow \lambda[N-1] =
      \pd{\ell_f}{\bx} \\ \forall n\in[0,N-1], \pd{L}{\bu[n]} =
      \pd{\ell(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bu} + \lambda^T[n] \pd{f_d(\bx[n],\bu[n])}{\bu}
      = 0. \end{gather*} Therefore, if we are given an initial condition $\bx_0$
      and an input trajectory $\bu[\cdot]$, we can verify that it satisfies the
      necessary conditions for optimality by simulating the system forward in
      time to solve for $\bx[\cdot]$, solving the adjoint equation backwards in
      time to solve for $\lambda[\cdot]$, and verifying that $\pd{L}{\bu[n]} =
      0$ for all $n$. The fact that $\pd{J}{\bu} = \pd{L}{\bu}$ when
      $\pd{L}{\bx} = 0$ and $\pd{L}{\lambda} = 0$ follows from some basic
      results in the calculus of variations.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Necessary conditions for optimality in continuous time</h1>

      <p>You won't be surprised to hear that these necessary conditions have an
      analogue in continuous time. I'll state it here without derivation.  Given
      the initial conditions, $\bx_0$, a continuous dynamics, $\dot\bx =
      f(\bx,\bu)$, and the instantaneous cost $\ell(\bx,\bu)$, for a trajectory
      $\bx(\cdot),\bu(\cdot)$ defined over $t\in[t_0,t_f]$  to  be optimal it
      must satisfy the conditions that \begin{align*} \forall
      t\in[t_0,t_f],\quad & \dot{\bx} = f(\bx,\bu), \quad &\bx(0)=\bx_0\\
      \forall t\in[t_0,t_f],\quad & -\dot\lambda = \pd{\ell}{\bx}^T +
      \pd{f}{\bx}^T \lambda, \quad &\lambda(T) = \pd{\ell_f}{\bx}^T \\ \forall
      t\in[t_0,t_f],\quad & \pd{\ell}{\bu} + \lambda^T\pd{f}{\bu} = 0.&
      \end{align*}</p>

      <p>In fact the statement can be generalized even beyond this to the case
      where $\bu$ has constraints. The result is known as Pontryagin's minimum
      principle -- giving <em>necessary conditions</em> for a trajectory to be
      optimal.</p>

      <theorem><h1>Pontryagin's Minimum Principle</h1>

        <p>Adapted from <elib>Bertsekas00a</elib>. Given the initial conditions,
        $\bx_0$, a continuous dynamics, $\dot\bx = f(\bx,\bu)$, and the
        instantaneous cost $\ell(\bx,\bu)$, for a trajectory
        $\bx^*(\cdot),\bu^*(\cdot)$ defined over $t\in[t_0,t_f]$  to  be optimal
        it must satisfy the conditions that \begin{align*} \forall
        t\in[t_0,t_f],\quad & \dot{\bx}^* = f(\bx^*,\bu^*), \quad
        &\bx^*(0)=\bx_0\\ \forall t\in[t_0,t_f],\quad & -\dot \lambda^* =
        \pd{\ell}{\bx}^T + \pd{f}{\bx}^T \lambda^*, \quad &\lambda^*(T) =
        \pd{\ell_f}{\bx}^T \\ \forall t\in[t_0,t_f],\quad & u^* =
        \argmin_{\bu\in{\cal U}} \left[\ell(\bx^*,\bu) + (\lambda^*)^T
        f(\bx^*,\bu) \right].& \end{align*}</p>

      </theorem>

      <p>Note that the terms which are minimized in the final line of the
      theorem are commonly referred to as the Hamiltonian of the optimal control
      problem, $$H(\bx,\bu,\lambda,t) = \ell(\bx,\bu) + \lambda^T f(\bx,\bu).$$
      It is distinct from, but inspired by, the Hamiltonian of classical
      mechanics. Remembering that $\lambda$ has an interpretation as
      $\pd{J}{\bx}^T$, you should also recognize it from the HJB. </p>

    <subsection id="differential_flatness"><h1>Differential Flatness</h1>

      <p>There are some very important cases where nonconvex trajectory
      optimization can be turned back into convex trajectory optimization based
      on a clever change of variables.  One of the key ideas in this space is
      the notion of "differential flatness", which is philosophically quite
      close to the idea of <a
      href="acrobot.html#partial_feedback_linearization">partial feedback
      linearization</a> that we discussed for acrobots and cart-pole systems.
      But perhaps the most famous applciation of differential flatness, which
      we will explore here, is actually for quadrotors.</p>

      <p>One of the most important lessons from partial feedback linearization,
      is the idea that if you have $m$ actuators, then you basically get to
      control exactly $m$ quantities of your system.  Differential flatness
      exploits this same idea (choosing $m$ outputs), but in the opposite
      direction.  The idea is that, for some systems, if you give me a
      trajectory in those $m$ coordinates, it may in fact dictate what all of
      the states/actuators must have been doing.  The fact that you can only
      execute a subset of possible trajectories can, in this case, make
      trajectory planning much easier!</p>

      <p>Let's start with an example...</p>

      <example><h1>Differential flatness for the Planar Quadrotor</h1>

        <p>The planar quadrotor model <a
        href="acrobot.html#planar_quadrotor">described earlier</a> has 3
        degrees of freedom ($x,y,\theta$) but only two actuators (one for each
        propellor).  My claim is that, if you give me a trajectory for just the
        location of the center of mass: $x(t), y(t), \forall t \in [t_0, t_f],$
        then I will be able to infer what $\theta(t)$ must be over that same
        interval in order to be feasible.  Furthermore, I can even infer
        $\bu(t)$. There is one technical condition required: the trajectory you
        give me for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ needs to be continuously differentiable
        (four times).</p>

        <p>To see this, recall the equations of motion for this system were
        given by: \begin{gather} m \ddot{x} = -(u_1 + u_2)\sin\theta,
        \label{eq:quad_x}\\ m \ddot{y} = (u_1 + u_2)\cos\theta - mg,
        \label{eq:quad_y}\\ I \ddot\theta = r (u_1 - u_2) \label{eq:quad_theta}
        \end{gather} Observe that from ($\ref{eq:quad_x}$) and
        ($\ref{eq:quad_y}$) we have $$\frac{-m \ddot{x}}{ m \ddot{y} + mg} =
        \frac{(u_1 + u_2)\sin\theta}{(u_1+u_2)\cos\theta} = \tan\theta.$$ In
        words, given $\ddot{x}(t)$ and $\ddot{y}(t)$, I can solve for
        $\theta$(t).  I can differentiate this relationship (in time) twice
        more to obtain $\ddot\theta$.  Using ($\ref{eq:quad_theta}$) with
        ($\ref{eq:quad_x}$) or ($\ref{eq:quad_y}$) give us two linear equations
        for $u_1$ and $u_2$ which are easily solved.</p>

        <p>Now you can see why we need the original trajectories to be smooth --
        the solution to $\bu(t)$ depends on $\ddot\theta(t)$ which depends on
        $\frac{d^4 x(t)}{dt^4}$ and $\frac{d^4 y(t)}{dt^4}$; we need those
        derivatives to exist along the entire trajectory.</p>

        <p>What's more -- if we ignore input limits for a moment -- <i>any</i>
        sufficiently smooth trajectory of $x(t), y(t)$ is feasible, so if I can
        simply find one that avoids the obstacles, then I have designed my state
        trajectory.  As we will see, optimizing even high-degree
        piecewise-polynomials is actually an easy problem (it works out to be a
        quadratic program), assuming the constraints are convex.  In practice,
        this means that once you have determined whether to go left or right
        around the obstacles, trajectory design is easy and fast.</p>

        <p>I've coded up a simple example of that for you here:</p>

          <p><a target="acrobot"
            href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/acrobot.ipynb#scrollTo=ZO_bsG2pA8bY"><img

              </p>

        <figure> <img width="100%" src="figures/differential_flatness.svg"/>
        <figcaption>Differential flatness for the planar quadrotor -- by solving
        a simple optimization to find a smooth trajectory for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$,
        I can back out $\theta(t)$ and even $\bu(t)$. </figcaption> </figure>

      </example>

      <p>The example above demonstrates that the planar quadrotor system is
      differentially flat in the outputs $x(t)$, $y(t)$.  More generally, if we
      have a dynamical system $$\dot{\bx} = f(\bx, \bu),$$ and we design some
      output coordinates (essentially "task-space"): $$\bz(t) = h\left(\bx, \bu,
      \frac{d\bu}{dt}, ..., \frac{d^k\bu}{dt^k}\right),$$ such that we can write
      the $\bx$ and $\bu$ purely as a function of the output and it's time
      derivatives, \begin{gather*} \bx (t) = \bx\left(\bz, \frac{d\bz}{dt}, ...,
      \frac{d^k\bz}{dt^k}\right), \\ \bu (t) = \bu\left(\bz, \frac{d\bz}{dt}, ..,
      \frac{d^k\bz}{dt^k}\right),\end{gather*} then we say that the system $f$ is
      differentially flat in the outputs $\bz$ <elib>Murray95</elib>.  And the
      requirement for showing that a system is differentially flat in those
      outputs is to write the function which solves for $\bx(t)$ and $\bu(t)$ as a
      function of only $\bz(t)$ and its time derivatives.</p>

      <p>I'm not aware of any numerical recipes for showing that a system is
      differentially flat nor for finding potential flat outputs, but I admit I
      haven't worked on it nor looked for those recipes.  That would be
      interesting!  I think of differential flatness as a property that one must
      find for your system -- typically via a little mechanical intuition and a
      lot of algebra.  Once found, it can be very useful.</p>

      <example><h1>Differential flatness for the 3D Quadrotor</h1>

        <p>Probably the most famous example of differential flatness is on the
        full 3D quadrotors. <elib>Mellinger11</elib> showed that the 3D quadrotor
        is differentially flat in the outputs $\{x,y,z,\theta_{yaw}\}$.  They used
        this, to dramatic effect, to perform all sorts of acrobatics.  The
        resulting videos are awesome (and probably deserve a lot of credit for the
        widespread popularity of quadrotors in academia and industry over the next
        few years).

        </figure>

        <p>A few things to note about these examples, just so we also understand
        the limitations.  First, the technique above is great for designing
        trajectories, but additional work is required to stabilizing those
        trajectories (we'll cover that topic in more detail later in the notes).
        Trajectory stabilization benefits greatly from good state estimation, and
        the examples above were all performed in a motion capture arena. Also,
        the "simple" version of the trajectory design that is fast enough to be
        used for flying through moving hoops is restricted to convex optimization
        formulations -- which means one has to hard-code apriori the decisions
        about whether to go left or right / up or down around each obstacle.</p>

      </example>

    <subsection><h1>Iterative LQR and Differential Dynamic
      Programming</h1>

        <p>There is another approach to trajectory optimization (at least for
        initial-value problems) that has gotten quite popular lately. Iterative
        LQR (iLQR)<elib>Li04</elib> also known as Sequential Linear Quadratic
        optimal control) <elib>Sideris05</elib>. The idea is simple enough:
        given an initial guess at the input and state trajectory, make a linear
        approximation of the dynamics and a quadratic approximation of the cost
        function.  Then compute and simulate the time-varying LQR controller to
        find a new input and state trajectory.  Repeat until convergence.</p>

        <p>The motivation behind iterative LQR is quite appealing -- it
        leverages the surprising structure of the Riccati equations to come up
        with a second-order update to the trajectory after a single backward
        pass of the Riccati equation followed by a forward simulation.
        Anecdotally, the convergence is fast and robust.  Numerous
        applications...<elib>Farshidian17+Tassa12</elib>.</p>


        <p>One key limitation of iLQR is that it only supports unconstrained
        trajectory optimization -- at least via the Riccati solution.  The
        natural extension for constrained optimization would be to replace the
        Riccati solution with an iterative linear model-predictive control
        (MPC) optimization; this would result in a quadratic program and is
        very close to what is happening in SQP.  But a more common approach in
        the current robotics literature is to add any constraints into the
        objective function using <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_method">penalty
        methods</a>, especially using <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Lagrangian_method">Augmented
        Lagrangian</a>.</p>

        <!--
        <p>Thinking about the MPC version of iLQR leads to a curious observation.  I
        think everyone using iLQR by solving Riccati equations is doing more work
        than they need to.  Clearly, in the discrete-time unconstrained form, the
        time-varying LQR + forward simulation is solving the following optimization
        problem: \begin{gather*} \min \sum_{n=0}^N  \bx[n]^T \bQ \bx[n] + ...
        \end{gather*}</p>
        -->

        <p>Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) <elib>Jacobson70</elib> is
        inspired by the idea of solving locally <i>quadratic</i> approximations
        of the HJB equations.  The resulting algorithm is almost identical to
        iLQR; the only difference is that DDP uses a second-order approximation
        of the plant dynamics instead of a first-order (linear) one.  The
        conventional wisdom is that taking these extra plant derivatives is
        probably not worth the extra cost of computing them; in most cases iLQR
        converges just as quickly (though the details will be problem
        dependent).  Unfortunately, despite the distinction between these
        algorithms being unambiguous and uncontroversial, you will find many
        papers that incorrectly write DDP when they are actually using
        iLQR.</p>

  <section><h1>Open Questions / Project Ideas</h1>

    <p>Here are some open questions that I have about the algorithms presented
    here.  I won't go so far as to say that the answers are not known, only
    that I don't know them, or at least that I would like to understand /
    implement them.  They could be great topics for a final project and/or great contributions to <drake></drake>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Direct collocation for second-order systems.  The cubic spline for
      state and first-order hold for inputs is a sweet spot for parameterizing
      the <a href="#direct_collocation">direct collocation</a> method for
      first-order systems.  We apply this to second-order systems by
      parameterizing the trajectories for $\bq(t)$ and $\dot{\bq}(t)$ as if
      they were independent, and only link them together through the dynamic
      constraints (<elib>Junge05</elib>, for instance, discusses how
      inefficient this can be).  Is there a sweet spot parameterization for
      second-order systems that still gives the third-order integration
      accuracy?  How much of a practical difference does this make for
      optimization on our model systems?</li>

      <li>Direct collocation with implicit dynamics.  The manipulation
      equations are naturally described in an <a
      href="lyapunov.html#ex:implicit">implicit form</a> that avoids
      unnecessary inversion of the mass matrix.  It's often possible, and
      substantially better, to write the dynamics constraints in trajectory
      optimization using this implicit form, ${\bf g}(\bq,\dot\bq,\ddot\bq,\bu)
      = 0$, instead of ${\bf f}(\bq,\dot\bq, \dot\bu) - \ddot\bq = 0.$  Can we
      use this for all three dynamic evaluations in the <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1trajectory__optimization_1_1_direct_collocation_constraint.html">direct
      collocation constraint</a>, which in explicit form evaluates ${\bf f}$ at
      the sample points in order to compute the expected derivative at the
      collocation point?</li>
    </ul>

    <todo>Update: I've resolved both of those; notes in headspace doc in goodnotes from May 29, 2021</todo>

  <section><h1>Exercises</h1>

    <exercise><h1>Direct Shooting vs Direct Transcription</h1>

      <p>In this coding exercise we explore in detail the <a href="#computational_considerations">computational advantages of direct transcription over direct shooting methods</a>.  The exercise can be completed entirely in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/exercises/trajopt/shooting_vs_transcription/shooting_vs_transcription.ipynb" target="_blank">python notebook</a>.  To simplify the analysis, we will apply these two methods to a finite-horizon LQR problem.  You are asked to complete four pieces of code:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Use the given implementation of direct shooting to analyze the numerical conditioning of this approach.</li>

        <li>Complete the given implementation of the direct transcription method.</li>

        <li>Verify that the cost to go from direct trascription approaches the LQR cost to go as the time horizon grows.</li>

        <li>Analyze the numerical conditioning of direct transcription.</li>

        <li>Implement the dynamic programming recursion (a.k.a. "Riccati recursion") to efficiently solve the linear algebra underlying the direct transcription method.</li>

      </ol>

    </exercise>

    <exercise><h1>Orbital Transfer via Trajectory Optimization</h1>

      <p>For this exercise you will work exclusively in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/exercises/trajopt/orbital_transfer/orbital_transfer.ipynb" target="_blank">this notebook</a>.  You are asked to find, via nonlinear trajectory optimization, a path that efficiently transfers a rocket from the Earth to Mars, while avoiding a cloud of asteroids.  The skeleton of the optimization problem is already there, but several important pieces are missing.  More details are in the notebook, but you will need to:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Enforce the maximum thrust constraints.</li>

        <li>Enforce the maximum velocity constraints.</li>

        <li>Ensure that the rocket does not collide with any of the asteroids.</li>

        <li>Add an objective function to minimize fuel consumption.</li>

      </ol>

    </exercise>

    <exercise><h1>Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator</h1>

      <p>The exercise is self-contained in
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/exercises/trajopt/ilqr_driving/ilqr_driving.ipynb"
        target="_blank">this notebook</a>.
        In this exercise you will derive and implement the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR).
        You will evaluate it's functionality by planning trajectories for an autonomous vehicle.
        You will need to:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Define an integrator for continuous dynamics.</li>

        <li>Compute a trajectory given an initial state and a control trajectory.</li>

        <li>Sum up the total cost of that trajectory.</li>

        <li>Derive the coefficients of the quadratic Q-function.</li>

        <li>Optimize for the optimal control law.</li>

        <li>Derive the update of the value function backwards in time.</li>

        <li>Implement the forward pass of iLQR.</li>

        <li>Implement the backward pass of iLQR.</li>

      </ol>
