    "## Problem Description\n",
    "In this problem we will be implementing the system identification algorithm for the perching glider described in [this paper](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Hoburg09a.pdf) (everything you need will be in the notebook but it's a quick read, so we encourage you to give it a look!). We will be simulating \"ground truth\" measurements around an approximate perching trajectory, and we will then search over sets of physically-inspired basis functions in order to choose the set that best fits the dynamics of our glider in a least-squares sense. This problem is just a short glimpse into some of the interesting work done on the perching glider task. For some interesting references take a look at sections [10.5](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/trajopt.html#perching), [18.2](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/sysid.html#section2) in the notes, and [this thesis](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Moore14b.pdf).\n",

We control our glider by actuating a control surface located at the tail called the \"elevator\" ($u = \\dot \\phi$). The forces depicted denote the force normal to the wing $f_w$ and normal to the elevator $f_e$. The full state of our glider is as follows:\n",

Below, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the glider, and $m$ is the mass of the glider:\n",

Below, we define the physical parameters of our system globally, and we implement a dynamics class that we will use to simulate our system and collect data trajectories.

We collect 15 trajectories, each of which starts with the glider being launched the forward roughly horizontally. While the glider is flying we execute a predetermined controller that approximately \"perches\" the glider. Each trajectory injects some random noise into this controller in order to capture a variety of different states in the dataset. We record the states and the accelerations for each of the trajectories, but we also collect accelerations in the \"plane\" frame. We will expand on this in the next section.

Each set contains lists of basis functions used to compute $\\hat{\\ddot x}_p$, $\\hat{\\ddot z}_p$, and $\\hat{\\ddot \\theta}_p$ respectively. Eventually we will update the configurations with the least-squares solution betas, and the one-step residuals summed over all sample points in our dataset. Note that in the paper, they try all combinations of the basis functions up to 3 basis functions per acceleration (meaning they use at most 3 basis functions to compute an acceleration). To save some time we include only 10 different combinations, with the best combination included. The methodology is the same. Nowadays, there exist a variety of algorithms we might use to search over basis functions (e.g. [LASSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics))).\n",
