<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 10"><h1>Policy
  Search</h1>
  <a style="float:right; margin-top:-80px;" target="policy_search" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/policy_search.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open Corresponding Notebook In Colab"/></a>
  <div style="clear:right;"></div>

  <p>In our case study on <a href="trajopt.html#perching">perching
  aircraft</a>, we solved a challenging control problem, but our approach to
  control design was based on only linear optimal control (around an optimized
  trajectory).  We've also discussed some approaches to nonlinear optimal
  control that could scale beyond small, discretized state spaces.  These were
  based on estimating the cost-to-go function, including
  <a href="dp.html#function_approximation">value iteration using function
  approximation</a> and approximate dynamic programming as a <a
  href="dp.html#LP">linear program</a>
  or as a <a href="lyapunov.html#adp">sums-of-squares program</a>.  </p>

  <p>There are a lot of things to like about methods that estimate the
  cost-to-go function (aka value function).  The cost-to-go function reduces
  the long-term planning problem into a one-step planning problem; it encodes
  all relevant information about the future (and nothing more).  The HJB gives
  us optimality conditions for the cost-to-go that give us a strong algorithmic
  handle to work with.  <!--But there is, I think, one very reasonable concern
  about value-based methods: we have seen many examples where the optimal
  cost-to-go function can be a very complicated function (by most measures of
  complexity; e.g. it would require a very fine discretization or high-degree
  polynomial to approximate accurately), even when the dynamics are smooth (or
  low-degree).  The swing-up problem for the pendulum is a nice example: the
  dynamics are smooth and simple, and even with a quadratic cost, the optimal
  policy is discontinuous (there are neighboring states that will take one
  "pump" or two pumps to reach the goal).--></p>

  <p>In this chapter, we will explore another very natural idea: let us
  parameterize a controller with some decision variables, and then search over
  those decision variables directly in order to achieve a task and/or optimize
  a performance objective.  One specific motivation for this approach is the
  (admittedly somewhat anecdotal) observation that often times simple policies
  can perform very well on complicated robots and with potentially complicated
  cost-to-go functions.</p>
  
  <p>We'll refer to this broad class of methods as "policy search" or, when
  optimization methods are used, we'll sometimes use "policy optimization".
  This idea has not received quite as much attention from the controls
  community, probably because we know many relatively simple cases where it
  does not work well.  But it has become very popular again lately due to the
  empirical success of "policy gradient" algorithms in reinforcement learning
  (RL).  This chapter includes a discussion of the "model-based" version of
  these RL policy-gradient algorithms; we'll describe their "model-free"
  versions in <a href="rl_policy_search.html">a future chapter</a>.
  </p>

  <section><h1>Problem formulation</h1>

    <p>Consider a static full-state feedback policy, $$\bu =
    \bpi_\balpha(\bx),$$ where $\bpi$ is potentially a nonlinear function, and
    $\balpha$ is the vector of parameters that describe the controller.  The
    control might take time as an input, or might even have it's own internal
    state, but let's start with this simple form.  </p>

    <p>Using our prescription for optimal control using additive costs, we can
    evaluate the performance of this controller from any initial condition
    using, e.g.: \begin{align*} J_\balpha(\bx) =& \int_0^\infty \ell(\bx(t),
    \bu(t)) dt, \\ \subjto \quad & \dot\bx = f(\bx, \bu), \quad \bu =
    \bpi_\balpha(\bx), \quad  \bx(0) = \bx.\end{align*}  In order to provide a
    scalar cost for each set of policy parameters, $\balpha$, we need one more
    piece: a relative importance for the different initial conditions.</p>

    <p>As we will further elaborate when we discuss <a
    href="robust.html">stochastic optimal control</a>, a very natural choice --
    one that preserves the recursive structure of the HJB -- is to optimize the
    expected value of the cost, given some distribution over initial
    conditions: $$\min_\balpha E_{\bx \sim {\mathcal X}_0} \left[J_\balpha(\bx)
    \right],$$ where ${\mathcal X}_0$ is a probability distribution over
    initial conditions, $\bx(0).$</p>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Linear Quadratic Regulator</h1>
  
    <p>To start thinking about the problem of searching directly in the policy
    parameters, it's very helpful to start with a problem we know and can
    understand well.  In LQR problems for linear, time-invariant systems, we
    know that the optimal policy is a linear function: $\bu = -{\bf K}\bx.$
    So far, we have always obtained ${\bf K}$ indirectly -- by solving a
    Riccati equation to find the cost-to-go and then backing out the optimizing
    policy.  Here, let us study the case where we parameterize the elements of
    ${\bf K}$ as decision variables, and attempt to optimize the expected
    cost-to-go directly.</p>
  
    <subsection><h1>Policy Evaluation</h1>

      <p>First, let's evaluate our objective for a given ${\bf K}$.  This step
      is known as "<i>policy evaluation</i>".  If we use a Gaussian with mean
      zero and covariance ${\bf \Omega}$ as our distribution over initial
      conditions, then for LQR we have \begin{align*} & E\left[ \int_0^\infty
      [\bx^T{\bf Q}\bx + \bu^T\bR\bu] dt \right], \\ \subjto \quad & \dot\bx =
      {\bf A}\bx + {\bf B}\bu, \quad \bu = - {\bf K}\bx, \quad \bx(0) \sim
      \mathcal{N}(0, {\bf \Omega}).\end{align*}   This problem is also known as
      the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal control problem<elib>Chen15a</elib>, since the
      expected-cost-to-go here is the $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm of the linear system
      from disturbance input (here only an impulse that generates our initial
      conditions) to performance output (which here would be e.g. $\bz =
      \begin{bmatrix} \bQ^{\frac{1}{2}}\bx \\ \bR^{\frac{1}{2}}\bu
      \end{bmatrix}).$</p>

      <p>To evaluate a policy $\bK$, let us first re-arrange the cost function
      slightly, using the properties of the matrix trace: \begin{gather*}
      \bx^T\bQ\bx + \bx^T\bK^T\bR\bK\bx = \bx^T(\bQ + \bK^T\bR\bK)\bx^T =
      \trace\left((\bQ + \bK^T\bR\bK)\bx\bx^T\right), \end{gather*} and the
      linearity of the integral and expected value: $$E\left[ \int_0^\infty
      \trace((\bQ + \bK^T\bR\bK)\bx\bx^T) dt \right] = \trace\left((\bQ +
      \bK^T\bR\bK) E \left[\int_0^\infty \bx\bx^T dt \right]\right),$$ For any
      given initial condition, the solution of the closed-loop dynamics is
      given by the matrix exponential: $$\bx(t) = e^{(\bA - \bB\bK)t}\bx(0).$$
      For the distribution of initial conditions, we have \begin{gather*}  \\
      E\left[\bx(t)\bx(t)^T\right] = e^{(\bA - \bB\bK)t}
      E\left[\bx(0)\bx(0)^T\right] e^{(\bA - \bB\bK)^Tt} = e^{(\bA - \bB\bK)t}
      {\bf \Omega} e^{(\bA - \bB\bK)^Tt}, \end{gather*} which is just a
      (symmetric) matrix function of $t$.  The integral of this function, call
      it ${\bf X}$, represents the expected 'energy' of the closed-loop
      response: $${\bf X} = E\left[ \int_0^\infty \bx \bx^T dt \right].$$
      Assuming $\bK$ is stabilizing, ${\bf X}$ can be computed as the (unique)
      solution to the Lyapunov equation: $$(\bA - \bB\bK){\bf X} + {\bf X}(\bA
      - \bB\bK)^T + {\bf \Omega} = 0.$$  (You can see a closely related derivation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controllability_Gramian">here</a>).  Finally, the total policy evaluation
      is given by \begin{equation}E_{\bx \sim \mathcal{N}(0,{\bf \Omega})}
      [J_\bK(\bx)] = \trace\left((\bQ + \bK^T\bR\bK){\bf
      X}\right)\label{eq:lqr_evaluation}.\end{equation}</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection id="lqr_lmi"><h1>A nonconvex objective in ${\bf K}$</h1>

      <p>Unfortunately, the Lyapunov equation represents a nonlinear constraint
      (on the pair $\bK$, ${\bf X}$).  Indeed, it is well known that even the
      set of controllers that stabilizing a linear systems can be nonconvex in
      the parameters $\bK$ when there are 3 or more state
      variables<elib>Fazel18</elib>.</p>

      <example><h1>The set of stabilizing $\bK$ can be non-convex</h1>

        <p>The following example was given in <elib>Fazel18</elib>.  Consider a
        discrete-time linear system with $\bA = {\bf I}_{3 \times 3}, \bB =
        {\bf I}_{3 \times 3}$. The controllers given by $${\bf K}_1 =
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -10 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
        \quad \text{and} \quad \bK_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -10 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0
        \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix},$$ are both stabilizing controllers for
        this system (all eigenvalues of $\bA - \bB\bK$ are inside the unit
        circle of the complex plane).  However the controller $\hat{\bK} =
        (\bK_1 + \bK_2)/2$ has two eigenvalues outside the unit circle.
           </p>
      
      </example>

      <p>Since the set of controllers that achieve finite total cost is
      non-convex, clearly the cost function we consider here is also
      non-convex.</p>  
      
      <p>As an aside, for this problem we do actually know a change of
      variables that make the problem convex.  Let's introduce a new variable
      ${\bf Y} = {\bf KX}.$  Since ${\bf X}$ is PSD, we can back out $\bK =
      {\bf YX}^{-1}.$  Now we can rewrite the optimization: \begin{align*}
      \min_{{\bf X}, {\bf Y}} & \quad \trace{\bQ^\frac{1}{2} {\bf X}
      \bQ^\frac{1}{2}} + \trace{\bR^\frac{1}{2} {\bf Y} {\bf X}^{-1} {\bf Y}^T
      \bR^\frac{1}{2}} \\ \subjto & \quad \bA{\bf X} - \bB{\bf Y} + {\bf
      X}\bA^T - {\bf Y}^T\bB^T + {\bf \Omega} = 0, \\ & \quad {\bf X} \succ
      0.\end{align*}  The second term in the objective appears to be nonconvex,
      but is actually convex.  In order to write it as a SDP, we can replace it
      exactly with one more slack variable, ${\bf Z}$, and a Schur
      complement<elib>Johnson07</elib>: \begin{align*} \min_{{\bf X}, {\bf Y},
      {\bf Z}} & \quad \trace{\bQ^\frac{1}{2} {\bf X} \bQ^\frac{1}{2}} +
      \trace{\bf Z} \\ \subjto & \quad \bA{\bf X} - \bB{\bf Y} + {\bf X}\bA^T -
      {\bf Y}^T\bB^T + {\bf \Omega} = 0, \\ & \quad \begin{bmatrix} {\bf Z} &
      \bR^\frac{1}{2} {\bf Y} \\ {\bf Y}^T \bR^\frac{1}{2} & {\bf X}
      \end{bmatrix} \succeq 0.\end{align*}</p>
      
      <p>Nevertheless, our original question is asking about searching directly
      in the original parameterization, $\bK$.  If the objective in nonconvex in those parameters, then how should we perform the search?</p>
  
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>No local minima</h1>
    
      <p>Although convexity is sufficient to guarantee that an optimization
      landscape does not have any local minima, it is not actually necessary.
      <elib>Fazel18</elib> showed that for this LQR objective, all local optima
      are in fact global optima.  This analysis was extended in
      <elib>Mohammadi19</elib> to give a simpler analysis and include
      convergence rates.</p>

      <p>How does one show that an optimization landscape has no local minima
      (even though it may be non-convex)?  One of the most popular tools is to
      demonstrate <i>gradient dominance</i> with the famous
      <i>Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) inequality</i> <elib>Karimi16</elib>.  For an
      optimization problem $$\min_{\bx \in \Re^d} f(\bx)$$ we first assume the
      function $f$ is $L$-smooth (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity">Lipschitz</a>
      gradients): $$\forall \bx,\bx', \quad \| \nabla f(\bx') - \nabla f(\bx)
      \|_2 \le L \| \bx' - \bx \|_2.$$ Then we say that the function satisfies
      the PL-inequality if the following holds for some $\mu > 0$: $$\forall
      \bx, \quad \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla f(\bx) \|_F^2 \ge \mu (f(\bx) - f^*),$$
      where $f^*$ is a value obtained at the optima.  In words, the gradient of
      the objective must grow faster than the gradient of a quadratic function.
      Note, however, that the distance here is measured in $f(\bx)$, not $\bx$;
      we do not require (nor imply) that the optimal solution is unique.  It
      clearly implies that for any minima, $\bx'$ with $\nabla f(x') = 0$,
      since the left-hand side is zero, we must have the right-hand side also
      be zero, so $x'$ is also a global optima: $f(x') = f^*$. </p>

      <!-- another way is to establish quasi-convexity ... etc -->
      
      <example><h1>A nonconvex function with no local minima</h1>
        
        <p>Consider the function $$f(x) = x^2 + 3 \sin^2(x).$$</p>

        <figure>
          <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;"
          seamless="seamless" src="data/pl_inequality.html" height="250"
          width="100%"></iframe>
        </figure>

        <p>We can establish that this function is not convex by observing that
        for $a=\frac{\pi}{4}$, $b=\frac{3\pi}{4}$, we have
        $$f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi^2}{4} + 3 \approx 5.47 >
        \frac{f(a)+f(b)}{2} = \frac{5\pi^2}{16} + \frac{3}{2} \approx 4.58.$$
        </p>

        <p>We can establish the PL conditions using the gradient $$\nabla f(x)
        = 2x + 6 \sin(x) \cos(x).$$  We can establish that this function is
        $L$-smooth with $L=8$ by $$\| \nabla f(b) - \nabla f(a) \|_2 = |2b - 2a
        + 6\sin(b-a)| \le 8|b - a|,$$ because $\sin(x) \le x.$  Finally, we
        have gradient-dominance from the PL-inequality:
        $$\frac{1}{2}(2x+6\sin(x)\cos(x))^2 \ge \mu(x^2 + 3\sin^2(x)),$$ with
        $\mu=0.175$. (I confirmed this with a small
        <a href="https://dreal.github.io/">dReal</a> <a
        href="examples/pl_inequality.py">program</a>).

      <p><elib>Karimi16</elib> gives a convergence rate for convergence to an
      optima for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a> given the PL conditions.
      <elib>Mohammadi19</elib> showed that the gradients of the LQR cost we
      examine here with respect to $\bK$ satisfy the PL conditions on any
      sublevel set of the cost-to-go function.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>True gradient descent</h1>
    
      <p>The results described above suggest that one can use gradient descent
      to obtain the optimal controller, $\bK^*$ for LQR.  For the variations
      we've seen so far (where we know the model), I would absolutely recommend
      that solving the Riccati equations is a much better algorithm; it is
      faster and more robust, with no parameters like step-size to tune.  But
      gradient descent becomes more interesting / viable when we think of it as
      a model for a less perfect algorithm, e.g. where the plant model is not
      given and the gradients are estimated from noisy samples.</p>

      <p>It is a rare luxury, due here to our ability to integrate the linear
      plants/controllers, quadratic costs, and Gaussian initial conditions,
      that we could compute the value function exactly in
      (\ref{eq:lqr_evaluation}).  We can also compute the true gradient -- this
      is a pinnacle of exactness we should strive for in our methods but will
      rarely achieve again.  The gradient is given by $$\pd{E[J_\bK(\bx)]}{\bK}
      = 2(\bR\bK - \bB^T{\bf P}){\bf X},$$ where ${\bf P}$ satisfies another
      Lyapunov equation: $$(\bA - \bB\bK)^T{\bf P} + {\bf P}(\bA - \bB\bK) +
      \bQ + \bK^T\bR\bK = 0.$$
      </p>

      <p>Note that the term <i>policy gradient</i> used in reinforcement
      learning typically refers to the slightly different class of algorithms I
      hinted at above. In those algorithms, we use the true gradients of the
      policy (only), but estimate the remainder of the terms in the gradient
      through sampling.  These methods typically require many samples to
      estimate the gradients we compute here, and should only be weaker (less
      efficient) than the algorithms in this chapter.  The papers investigating
      the convergence of gradient descent for LQR have also started exploring
      these cases.  We will study these so-called <a
      href="rl_policy_search.html">model-free" policy search</a>
      algorithms soon.</p>
      
    </subsection>

  </section>

  <section><h1>More convergence results and counter-examples</h1>

    <p>LQR / $\mathcal{H}_2$ control is one of the good cases, where we know
    that for the objective parameterized directly in $\bK$, all local optima
    are global optima.  <elib>Zhang20</elib> extended this result for mixed
    $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control.  <elib>Agarwal20a</elib> gives a
    recent treatment of the tabular (finite) MDP case. </p>

    <p>For LQR, we also know alternative parameterizations of the controller
    which make the objective actually convex, including the <a
    href="lqr.html#lmi">LMI formulation</a> and the <a
    href="lqr.html#sls">Youla parameterization</a>.  Their utility in a policy
    search setting was studied initially in <elib>Roberts11</elib>.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, we do not expect these nice properties to hold in
    general.  There are a number of nearby problems which are known to be
    nonconvex in the original parameters.  The case of <i>static output
    feedback</i> is an important one.  If we extend our plant model to include
    (potentially limited) observations: $\dot\bx = \bA\bx + \bB\bu, \by =
    \bC\bx,$ then searching directly over controllers, $\bu = -{\bf K}\by$, is
    known to be NP-hard<elib>Blondel97</elib>.  This time, the set of stabilizing ${\bf K}$ matrices may be not only nonconvex, but actually disconnected.  We can see that with a simple example (given to me once
    during a conversation with Alex Megretski). 
    </p>

    <example><h1>Parameterizations of Static Output Feedback</h1>

    <p>Consider the single-input, single-output LTI system $$\dot{\bx} = {\bf
    A}\bx + {\bf B} u, \quad y = {\bf C}\bx,$$ with $${\bf A} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}, \quad {\bf B} =
    \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad {\bf C} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}.$$  Here the linear static-output-feedback policy
    can be written as $u = -ky$, with a single scalar parameter $k$. </p>

    <p>Here is a plot of the maximum eigenvalue (real-part) of the closed-loop
    system, as a function of $k$.  The system is only stable when this maximum
    value is less than zero.  You'll find the set of stabilizing $k$'s is a
    disconnected set.</p>

    <figure><img width="80%" src="data/static_feedback_disconnected.svg"/></figure>

    </example>

    <p>There are many other known counter-examples.  <elib>Bhandari20</elib>
    gives a particularly simple one with a two state MDP.  One of the big open
    questions is whether deep network parameterizations are an example of a
    good case.</p>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Trajectory-based policy search</h1>

    <p>Although we cannot expect gradient descent to converge to a global
    minima in general, it is still very reasonable to try using gradient
    descent to find policies for more complicated nonlinear control problems.
    In the general form, this means that the first step of optimizing
    $$\min_\balpha E_{\bx \sim {\mathcal X}_0} \left[J_\balpha(\bx) \right],$$
    is estimating $$\pd{}{\balpha} E_{\bx \sim {\mathcal X}_0}
    \left[J_\balpha(\bx) \right].$$  In the LQR problem, we were able to
    compute these terms exactly; with the biggest simplification coming from
    the fact that <a href="stochastic.html#linear_gaussian">the response of a
    linear system to Gaussian initial conditions stays Gaussian</a>. This is
    not true for more general nonlinear systems.  So what are we to do?</p>

    <p>The most common/general technique (despite it not being very efficient),
    is to approximate the expected cost-to-go using a sampling (Monte-Carlo)
    approximation using a large number, $N$, of samples: $$E_{\bx \sim
    {\mathcal X}_0}[J_\balpha(\bx)] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}
    J_\balpha(\bx_i), \quad \bx_i \sim \mathcal{X}_0.$$  The gradients follow
    easily: $$\pd{}{\balpha} E_{\bx \sim {\mathcal X}_0}[J_\balpha(\bx)]
    \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \pd{J_\balpha(\bx_i)}{\balpha}, \quad
    \bx_i \sim \mathcal{X}_0.$$  Our confidence in the accuracy of this
    estimate will improve as we increase $N$; see e.g. Section 4.2 of
    <elib>Rubinstein16</elib> for details on the confidence intervals.  The
    most optimistic among us will say that it's quite fine to have only a noisy
    estimate of the gradient -- this leads to stochastic gradient descent which
    can have some very desirable properties.  But it does make the algorithm
    harder to analyze and debug.</p>

    <p>Using the Monte-Carlo estimator, the total gradient update is just a sum
    over gradients with respect to particular initial conditions,
    $\pd{J_\balpha(\bx_i)}{\balpha}.$  But for finite-horizon objectives, these
    are precisely the gradients that we have already studied in the context of
    trajectory optimization.  They can be computed efficiently using an adjoint
    method.  The difference is that here we think of $\balpha$ as the
    parameters of a feedback controller, whereas before we thought of them as
    the parameters of a trajectory, but this makes no difference to the chain
    rule.</p>

    <p>In the chapter on Lyapunov analysis we also explored a handful
    techniques <a href="lyapunov.html#control">for control design</a>.  <a
    href="lyapunov.html#control_alternations">One of these</a> even directly
    parameterized the controller (as a polynomial feedback), and used
    alternations to switch between policy evaluation and policy optimization.
    <a href="lyapunov.html#adp">Another</a> generated lower-bounds to the
    optimal cost-to-go.</p>
