<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 13"><h1>Robust and
  Stochastic Control</h1>
  
  <p>So far in the notes, we have concerned ourselves with only known,
  deterministic systems.  In this chapter we will begin to consider uncertainty.
  This uncertainy can come in many forms... we may not know the governing
  equations (e.g. the coefficient of friction in the joints), our robot may be
  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNZPRsrwumQ?t=32">walking on unknown terrain,
  subject to unknown disturbances</a>, or even be picking up unknown objects.
  There are a number of mathematical frameworks for considering this
  uncertainty; for our purposes this chapter will generalizing our thinking to
  equations of the form: $$\dot\bx = {\bf f}(\bx, \bu, \bw, t) \qquad \text{or}
  \qquad \bx[n+1] = {\bf f}(\bx[n], \bu[n], \bw[n], n),$$ where $\bw$ is a new
  <i>random</i> input signal to the equations capturing all of this potential
  variability. Although it is certainly possible to work in continuous time, and
  treat $\bw(t)$ as a continuous-time random signal (c.f. <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process">Wiener process</a>), it is
  notationally simpler to work with $\bw[n]$ as a discrete-time random signal.
  For this reason, we'll devote our attention in this chapter to the
  discrete-time systems.</p>

  <p>In order to simulate equations of this form, or to design controllers
  against them, we need to define the random process that generates $\bw[n]$. It
  is typical to assume the values $\bw[n]$ are independent and identically
  distributed (i.i.d.), meaning that $\bw[i]$ and $\bw[j]$ are uncorrelated when
  $i \neq j$.  As a result, we typically define our distribution via a
  probability density $p_{\bf w}(\bw[n])$.  This is not as limiting as it may
  sound... if we wish to treat temporally-correlated noise (e.g. "colored
  noise") the format of our equations is rich enough to support this by adding
  additional state variables; we'll give an example below of a "whitening
  filter" for modeling wind gusts.  The other source of randomness that we will
  now consider in the equations is randomness in the initial conditions; we will
  similarly define a probabilty density $p_\bx(\bx[0]).$</p>

  <p>This modeling framework is rich enough for us to convey the key ideas; but
  it is not quite sufficient for all of the systems I am interested in.  In
  <drake></drake> we go to additional lengths to support more general cases of
  <a
  href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__stochastic__systems.html">stochastic
  systems</a>.  This includes modeling system parameters that are drawn from
  random each time the model is initialized, but are fixed over the duration of
  a simulation; it is possible but inefficient to model these as additional
  state variables that have no dynamics.  In other problems, even the
  <i>dimension of the state vector</i> may change in different realizations of
  the problem!  Consider, for instance, the case of a robot manipulating random
  numbers of dishes in a sink. I do not know many control formulations that
  handle this type of randomness well, and I consider this a top priority to
  think more about!  (We'll begin to address it in the <a href="output_feedback.html">output feedback chapter</a>.)</p>
  
  <p>Roughly speaking, I will refer to "stochastic control" as the discipline of
  synthesizing controllers that govern the probabilistic evolution of the
  equations.  "Stochastic optimal control" defines a cost function (now a random
  variable), and tries to find controllers that optimize some metric such as the
  expected cost.  When we use the terms "robust control", we are typically
  referring to a class of techniques that try to guarantee a worst-case
  performance or a worst-case bound on the effect of randomness on the input on
  the randomness on the output.  Interestingly, for many robust control
  formulations we do not attempt to know the precise probability distribution of
  $\bx[0]$ and $\bw[n]$, but instead only define the <i>sets</i>
  of possible values that they can take.  This modeling is powerful, but can
  lead to conservative controllers and pessimistic estimates of performance.</p>

  <p>My goal of presenting a relatively consumable survey of a few of the main
  ideas is perhaps more important in this chapter than any other.  It's been
  said that "robust control is encrypted" (as in you need to know the secret
  code to get in).  The culture in the robust control community has been to
  leverage high-powered mathematics, sometimes at the cost of offering more
  simple explanations.  This is unfortunate, I think, because robotics and
  machine learning would benefit from a richer connection to these tools, and
  are perhaps destined to reinvent many of them.</p>
  
  <p>The classic reference for robust control is <elib>Zhou97</elib>.
  <elib>Petersen00</elib> has a treatment that does more of it's development in
  the time-domain and via Riccati equations.</p>

  <section><h1>Finite Markov Decision Processes</h1>

    <p>We already had quick preview into stochastic optimal control in one of the cases where it is particularly easy: <a href="dp.html#mdp">finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)</a>.</p>

  <section><h1>Linear optimal control</h1>

    <subsection><h1>Analysis</h1>
    
      <subsubsection><h1>Common Lyapunov functions</h1>
        <p>We've already seen one nice example of robustness analysis for
        linear systems when we wrote a small optimization to find a <a
        href="lyapunov.html#common-lyapunov-linear">common Lyapunov function
        for uncertain linear systems</a>.  That example studied the dynamics
        $\bx[n+1] = \bA \bx[n]$ where the coefficients of $\bA$ were unknown
        but bounded.</p>  
      
        <p><a href="lyapunov.html#common-lyapunov">We also saw</a> that
        essentially the same technique can be used to certify stability against
        disturbances, e.g.: $$\bx[n+1] = \bA\bx[n] + \bw[n], \qquad \bw[n] \in
        \mathcal{W},$$ where $\mathcal{W}$ describes some bounded set of
        possible uncertainties.  In order to be compatible with convex
        optimization, we often choose to describe $\mathcal{W}$ as either an
        ellipsoid or as a convex polytope<elib>Boyd04a</elib>.  But let's
        remember a very important point: in this situation with additive
        disturbances, we can no-longer expect the system to converge stably to
        the origin.  Our example before used the common Lyapunov function only
        to certify the <i>invariance</i> of a region (if I start inside some region, then I'll never leave).</p>

      </subsubsection>
 
      <subsubsection><h1>$L_2$ gain</h1>

        <p>In some sense, the common-Lyapunov analysis above is probably the
        wrong analysis for linear systems (perhaps other systems as well).  It
        might be unreasonable to assume that disturbances are bounded.
        Moreover, we know that the response to an input (including the
        disturbance input) is linear, so we expect the magnitude of the
        deviation in $\bx$ compared to the undisturbed case to be proportional
        to the magnitude of the disturbance, $\bw$.  A more natural bound for a
        linear system's response is to bound the magnitude of the response
        (from zero initial conditions) relative to the magnitude of the
        disturbance.  
        </p>
        
        <!--
        <example><h1>Gain bounds for linear maps</h1>
          <p>Allow me to make the point with a much simpler problem.  Imagine I
          have just a affine function (not even a system): $x = aw$.  One could certainly make the statement: if $|w|\le 1$, then $|x| \le |a|$</p>
        </example>
        -->
        <p>
        Typically, this is done with the a scalar "$L_2$
        gain", $\gamma$, defined as: \begin{align*}\argmin_\gamma \quad
        \subjto& \quad \sup_{\bw(\cdot) \in \int \|\bw(t)\|^2 dt\le \infty}
        \frac{\int_0^T \| \bx(t) \|^2 dt}{\int_0^T \| \bw(t) \|^2dt} \le
        \gamma^2, \qquad \text{or} \\ \argmin_\gamma \quad \subjto&
        \sup_{\bw[\cdot] \in \sum_n \|\bw[n]\|^2 \le \infty} \frac{\sum_0^N
        \|\bx[n]\|^2}{\sum_0^N \| \bw[n] \|^2} \le \gamma^2.\end{align*} The
        name "$L_2$ gain" comes from the use of the $\ell_2$ norm on the
        signals $\bw(t)$ and $\bx(t)$, which is assumed only to be finite.</p>
      
        <p>More often, these gains are written not in terms of $\bx[n]$
        directly, but in terms of some "performance output", $\bz[n]$.  For
        instance, if would would like to bound the cost of a quadratic
        regulator objective as a function of the magnitude of the disturbance,
        we can minimize $$ \min_\gamma \quad \subjto \quad \sup_{\bw[n]}
        \frac{\sum_0^N \|\bz[n]\|^2}{\sum_0^N \| \bw[n] \|^2} \le \gamma^2,
        \qquad \bz[n] = \begin{bmatrix}\sqrt{\bQ} \bx[n] \\ \sqrt{\bR}
        \bu[n]\end{bmatrix}.$$  This is a simple but important idea, and
        understanding it is the key to understanding the language around robust
        control.  In particular the $H_2$ norm of a system (from input $\bw$ to
        output $\bz$) is the energy of the impulse response; when $\bz$ is
        chosen to represent the quadratic regulator cost as above, it
        corresponds to the expected LQR cost.  The $H_\infty$ norm of a system
        (from $\bw$ to $\bz$) is the largest singular value of the transfer
        function; it corresponds to the $L_2$ gain.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Linear Exponential-Quadratic Gaussian (LEQG)</h1>

      <p><elib>Jacobson73</elib> observed that it is also straight-forward to
      minimize the objective: $$J = E\left[ \prod_{n=0}^\infty e^{\bx^T[n] {\bf
      Q} \bx[n]} e^{\bu^T[n] {\bf R} \bu[n]} \right] = E\left[
      e^{\sum_{n=0}^\infty \bx^T[n] {\bf Q} \bx[n] + \bu^T[n] {\bf R} \bu[n]}
      \right],$$ with ${\bf Q} = {\bf Q}^T \ge {\bf 0}, {\bf R} = {\bf R}^T >
      0,$ by observing that the cost is monotonically related to $\log{J}$, and
      therefore has the same minima (this same trick forms the basis for
      "geometric programming" <elib>Boyd07</elib>). This is known as the
      "Linear Exponential-Quadratic Gaussian" (LEG or LEQG), and for the
      deterministic version of the problem (no process nor measurement noise)
      the solution is identical to the LQR problem; it adds no new modeling
      power.  But with noise, the LEQG optimal controllers are different from
      the LQG controllers; they depend explicitly on the covariance of the
      noise.  
        
      <todo>introduce the coefficient \sigma here, instead of just throwing it
      in from the start. The coefficient $\sigma$ in the objective is referred
      to as the "risk-sensitivity parameter" <elib>Whittle90</elib>.
      </todo>
      </p>

      <todo>Insert simplest form of the derivation here, plus an example.</todo>

      <p><elib>Whittle90</elib> provides an extensive treatment of this framework;
      nearly all of the analysis from LQR/LQG (including Riccati equations,
      Hamiltonian formulations, etc) have analogs for their versions with
      exponential cost, and he argues that LQG and H-infinity control can
      (should?) be understood as special cases of this approach.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Adaptive control</h1>

      <p>The standard criticism of $H_2$ optimal control is that minimizing the
      expected value does not allow any guarantees on performance.  The
      standard criticism of $H_\infty$ optimal control is that it concerns
      itself with the worst case, and may therefore be conservative, especially
      because distributions over possible disturbances chosen a priori may be
      unnecessarily conservative.  One might hope that we could get some of
      this performance back if we are able to update our models of uncertainty
      online, adapting to the statistics of the disturbances we actually
      receive.  This is one of the goals of adaptive control.</p> 

      <p>One of the fundamental problems in online adaptive control is the
      trade-off between exploration and exploitation.  Some inputs might drive
      the system to build more accurate models of the dynamics / uncertainty
      quickly, which could lead to better performance.  But how can we
      formalize this trade-off?
      </p>

      <p>There has been some nice progress on this challenge in machine
      learning in the setting of (contextual) <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed
      bandit</a>  problems.  For our purposes, you can think of bandits as a
      limiting case of an optimal control problem where there are no dynamics
      (the effects of one control action do not effect the results of the next
      control action).  In this simpler setting, the online optimization
      community has developed exploration-exploitation strategies based on the
      notion of minimizing <i>regret</i> -- typically the accumulated
      difference in the performance achieved by my online algorithm vs the
      performance that would have been achieved if I had been privy to the data
      from my experiments before I started.  This has led to methods that make
      use of concepts like upper-confidence bound (UCB) and more recently
      bounds using a least-squares squares confidence bound
      <elib>Foster20</elib> to provide bounds on the regret.</p>

      <p>In the last few years, we've see these results translated into the setting of linear optimal control... </p>
