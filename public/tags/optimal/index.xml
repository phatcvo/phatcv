      <description>ROS Motion Planning Motion planning is a computational problem to find a sequence of valid configurations that moves the object from the source to destination. Generally, it includes Path Searching and Trajectory Optimization.
Path Searching: Based on path constraints, e.g. obstacles, it searches an optimal path sequence for the robot to travel without conflicts between source and destination.
Trajectory Planning: Based on the kinematics, dynamics and obstacles, it optimizes a motion state trajectory from the source to destination according to the path sequence.</description>
