      <description>Introduction The goal of this document is to keep track the state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning. It starts with basics in reinforcement learning and deep learning to introduce the notations and covers different classes of deep RL methods, value-based or policy-based, model-free or model-based, etc.
Different classes of deep RL methods can be identified. This document will focus on the following ones:
Value-based algorithms (DQN&amp;hellip;) used mostly for discrete problems like video games.</description>
