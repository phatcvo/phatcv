      <description>Basics Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the integration of deep learning methods, classically used in supervised or unsupervised learning contexts, with reinforcement learning (RL), a well-studied adaptive control method used in problems with delayed and partial feedback [@Sutton1998]. This section starts with the basics of RL, mostly to set the notations, and provides a quick overview of deep neural networks.&#xA;Table of contents Reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Process Policy and value functions Bellman equations Dynamic programming Monte-Carlo sampling Temporal Difference Eligibility traces Actor-critic architectures Function approximation Value-based function approximation Policy-based function approximation Reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Process RL methods apply to problems where an agent interacts with an environment in discrete time steps (@fig:agentenv).</description>
