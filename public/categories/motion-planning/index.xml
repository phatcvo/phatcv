      <description>ROS Motion Planning Motion planning is a computational problem to find a sequence of valid configurations that moves the object from the source to destination. Generally, it includes Path Searching and Trajectory Optimization.
Path Searching: Based on path constraints, e.g. obstacles, it searches an optimal path sequence for the robot to travel without conflicts between source and destination.
Trajectory Planning: Based on the kinematics, dynamics and obstacles, it optimizes a motion state trajectory from the source to destination according to the path sequence.</description>

      <description>Motion Planning There are a few more essential skills that we need in our toolbox. In this chapter, we will explore some of the powerful methods of kinematic trajectory motion planning.
I&amp;rsquo;m actually almost proud of making it this far into the notes without covering this topic yet. Writing a relatively simple script for the pose of the gripper, like we did in the bin picking chapter, really can solve a lot of interesting problems.</description>
